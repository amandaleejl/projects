'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\", 'author_fullname': 't2_3jjbxvfb', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'How to Survive Camping: blood forcibly taken', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'flair-series', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fha5qz', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 539, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Series', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 539, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_2': 1}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584013105.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/\"&gt;how badly things went last week&lt;/a&gt;.  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.

The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key.

It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though.

She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\", 'author_fullname': 't2_2y34eooe', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'There’s something wrong with my cat', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh8ovn', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 133, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 133, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584006709.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cat is acting a bit… off.

It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though.

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh.

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Run.” Chloe whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Adrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Think you can climb?” She asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://thehorrorstore.home.blog\"&gt;“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8beec82a-dcc1-11e8-a09f-0e09eae1a1c0', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh4nc9', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'googlyeyes93', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 11, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh4nc9/i_was_legally_dead_for_four_minutes_there_is_no/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh4nc9/i_was_legally_dead_for_four_minutes_there_is_no/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583961749.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)', 'author_fullname': 't2_hw0t0', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'How to Gain Six Inches in Less Than 24 Hours', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fguqho', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 1361, 'total_awards_received': 2, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 1361, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_2': 1}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583949623.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is a kitchen witch.

The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lughnasadh.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I &lt;em&gt;dying?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Short, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The poor idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t know, Mike,&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. &lt;em&gt;Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I was losing a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor handsome idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, is … is this blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy\"&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 50, 'id': 'award_b4ff447e-05a5-42dc-9002-63568807cfe6', 'penny_donate': None, 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'icon_height': 2048, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49b775b684dcffe79df3e103d71055a7925d6c37', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e8c0e96f4a97ee1bf582ab8f9a21e06fc85e01', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6fb9ecfb8eee4493afe6c5b234c44eb8413008', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ea8c05c28899739458535e90d97210889aea91', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/rg960rc47jj41_All-SeeingUpvote.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093c7a95723b58ea1373bf62223e2ae7f11323fb', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'description': 'A glowing commendation for all to see', 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'name': 'All-Seeing Upvote', 'icon_format': None, 'award_sub_type': 'PREMIUM', 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global'}, {'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 500, 'id': 'gid_2', 'penny_donate': None, 'coin_reward': 100, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 7, 'icon_height': 512, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'description': 'Gives the author a week of Reddit Premium, %{coin_symbol}100 Coins to do with as they please, and shows a Gold Award.', 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'name': 'Gold', 'icon_format': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fguqho', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'deathbyproxy', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 55, 'send_replies': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fguqho/how_to_gain_six_inches_in_less_than_24_hours/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fguqho/how_to_gain_six_inches_in_less_than_24_hours/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583920823.0, 'num_crossposts': 2, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': '*In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.*\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)\\n\\nIt was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)', 'author_fullname': 't2_4leylht9', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Why You Should Always Honk If You\\'re Horny - A \"Rules of the Road\" Entry, Part 2 of 2', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'flair-series', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh858z', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 65, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Series', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 65, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584004517.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/\"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8beec82a-dcc1-11e8-a09f-0e09eae1a1c0', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh858z', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'throwawayaracehorse', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 4, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh858z/why_you_should_always_honk_if_youre_horny_a_rules/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh858z/why_you_should_always_honk_if_youre_horny_a_rules/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583975717.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'I\\'m sitting in the living room, a full glass of red wine is in my hand.

I\\'m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.\\n\\n\"-awful thing to happen-\"\\n\\n\"She was so young, it didn\\'t look like anything was wrong-\"\\n\\n\"-I hope the family will be okay-\"\\n\\n\"-No, I don\\'t know why she did it-\"\\n\\n\"Is that the boy who found her?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, he\\'s been sitting there since they came back.\"\\n\\n\"Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.\\n\\n\"No,\" the bartender said softly, \"but... look, son, I think I know what\\'s going through your head.\"\\n\\nI looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t go down that road. There\\'s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don\\'t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It\\'ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n\"It already has,\" I say softly, \"and it\\'s gotten my family now.\" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I\\'m not going to work. I\\'ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I\\'ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.\\n\\nI know where the Prophet will be. He\\'ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn\\'t.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for a homecoming.', 'author_fullname': 't2_intwk', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Grief', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fgzz0j', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 265, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 265, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': True, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1583950774.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583973305.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting in the living room, a full glass of red wine is in my hand.

I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her.

The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I&amp;#39;m done, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying anymore. I&amp;#39;m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don&amp;#39;t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don&amp;#39;t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They&amp;#39;re also crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny&amp;#39;s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t say anything. It&amp;#39;s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny&amp;#39;s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he&amp;#39;s the man who tried to make me support my granny.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m naked and look at the bed. No one&amp;#39;s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don&amp;#39;t know. They might as well be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get dressed until I&amp;#39;ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven&amp;#39;t flushed since last night, and don&amp;#39;t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn&amp;#39;t I save them?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I&amp;#39;m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It&amp;#39;s the man from Jenny&amp;#39;s funeral. He&amp;#39;s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There&amp;#39;s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They&amp;#39;ve changed. Where&amp;#39;s granda? I don&amp;#39;t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord&amp;#39;s Chosen,&amp;quot; she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, &amp;quot;he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say aloud then walk up to the bar. &amp;quot;Hey, can you turn that up?&amp;quot; I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my family on there.&amp;quot; His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he&amp;#39;d visited.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s impossible. There&amp;#39;s no way that... no way that this man... &amp;quot;Who is that?&amp;quot; I ask when the black man is on the screen again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calls himself the Prophet,&amp;quot; the barman says, &amp;quot;cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prophet,&amp;quot; I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That. Utter. Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fgzz0j', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'SpaceGeneralAmerica', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 14, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fgzz0j/grief/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgzz0j/grief/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583944505.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': ' \\n\\nI studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it.

Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh9iqd', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'iUsed2EatPeople', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 4, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh9iqd/while_working_as_a_game_tester_i_found_a/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh9iqd/while_working_as_a_game_tester_i_found_a/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583981432.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing.

I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared.

He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you.

Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired.

A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will.

Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fgxiok', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'harrydownto', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 11, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fgxiok/one_of_my_alzheimers_patients_said_something_that/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgxiok/one_of_my_alzheimers_patients_said_something_that/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583934902.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'I don\\'t know what uttered me to spit out those few words, I didn\\'t want to know what they meant.

My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn\\'t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nA familiar voice spoke:\\n\\n\\\\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I\\'ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...\\n\\nHung up.\\n\\nI thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood.

My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn&amp;#39;t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he&amp;#39;s okay, to which he replied: &amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...&amp;quot;. Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with &amp;quot;What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?&amp;quot; He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right.

He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)', 'author_fullname': 't2_11d38ddb', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'It Pulls You Down.

Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?  What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you think happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You.&lt;/em&gt;”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/9ndww5\"&gt;And now the man was killing him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': 'May 2019', 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh4b5y', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Verastahl', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 1, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh4b5y/it_pulls_you_down_part_four/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh4b5y/it_pulls_you_down_part_four/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583960492.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': 'Sometimes the truth lies just before our eyes, but we refuse to see it.

I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.\\n\\nThe last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.\\n\\nWhat I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.\\n\\nA voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Homo homini lupus.* Man is a wolf to man.', 'author_fullname': 't2_5qn3elvd', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': \"I uncovered a three hundred years old family secret.

I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old priest about this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still.

He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast.

Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater.

The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper.

They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy.

I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. \\n\\nThanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. \\n\\nWhen we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. \\n\\nMy hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. \\n\\nSome of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. \\n\\nMy father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. \\n\\nSo instead I made those men a promise. \\n\\n“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food. The monsters were grateful and after the meat was torn from the scientist’s body, they tossed the rest into a large hole and gestured for me to follow into the mountain. \\n\\nIn such a remote wilderness, over the years we have found it easy to stay hidden. I watched as scientists came and left trying to study the after effects of the crater. I realized also I had been given some of these as a result of simply being close to my father and the others. They have become less and less human over the years, unable to die and tormented by their ghastly appearance and their mental deterioration. \\n\\nI have tried to help them as best as I can, moving them to stay hidden and hunting food here in the Siberian waste. But we will never again be a part of the world that we once knew. I died that day when the sky split. I’ve lived as a ghost ever since. \\n\\nI tell all of this knowing now that I likely will be losing touch of my own sensibilities soon, the effects of the meteorite finally taking its full toll on me. And then living as a monster, likely for the rest of eternity. \\n\\nOnce my own mind is gone, nothing will prevents these creatures from venturing beyond isolation. From finding life that can be used to hunt and to kill and to infect others. \\n\\nAll I can say is that we are sorry, we cannot control this curse that has been with us all these years. If you do encounter us, my only advice would be to run. \\n\\n[Run and hide](https://youtu.be/mWVPG8czpI4)\\n\\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)', 'author_fullname': 't2_wldw2ed', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'I know the truth about the Tunguska Event.

I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres.

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys.

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Only I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But again, I knew better. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Douglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Douglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Douglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch.

Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.\\n\\n11:45 PM\\n\\nI’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.

I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.\\n\\n11:54 PM\\n\\nIncident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n11:59 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but\\n\\n3/8/2020 12:01 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.\\n\\n12:09 AM\\n\\nPrevious  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**\\n\\n12:29 AM\\n\\nIn  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.

I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.

On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:52 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:54 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.

They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_5wplc085', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'The Extra Rooms', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh7ijt', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 20, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 20, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584001820.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people&amp;#39;s houses.

That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. \\n\\nOctober nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.\\n\\nAfter class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”\\n\\n“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. \\n\\n“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.\\n\\nLeo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” \\n\\nI was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. \\n\\n“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.\\n\\n“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. \\n\\nI pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!\\n\\n“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.\\n\\nI could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.\\n\\n“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.\\n\\nThey were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. \\n\\nThe warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. \\n\\nBrandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. \\n\\n“Shani?” \\n\\nI choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice.

That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Leo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Brandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Shani?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was the monster that had taken her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;——————————————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone!

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years.

I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it.

Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fhc04y', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Angelena100', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 2, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fhc04y/my_name_is_project_124_part_two/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fhc04y/my_name_is_project_124_part_two/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583994350.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': '\\nI first saw the clock as a child in the hall at my grandfathers house.

[Part I]\\n\\nIt was only 9:00 am when it started spreading.\\n\\nThere had been subtle vibrations from the ground for the past few weeks. I thought nothing of it until it crept up to the walls. My friend Kathrine was over and she had just stolen my phone and ran off. I pinned her to the wall playfully, laughing and trying to retrieve my phone when her smile faded into concern. “Everything alright?” I asked her. We stood silently for a moment, Katherine still against the wall. “Come feel this.” She said moving out of the way. I put my hand against the wall but lept back when I felt the throbbing. I stood for a moment pondering where I had felt this before. Katherine spoke up “I think...I think it’s in the floor too.” I looked at her surprisingly as I thought I had imagined the floor vibrating. I gave a nervous laugh “It’s probably the vents or something!” We stood still again not knowing what to do or say. \\n\\nA few hours after Katherine had left I started getting curious about the vibrations again. I was at my kitchen bar which was connected to the wall so I just leaned my head over about 2 inches away from the wall, to see if I could hear anything first. The vents weren’t on, which made sense because it was a fine spring day. I then very slowly placed my hand on the wall. The vibrations were there again, but...why couldn’t I hear them before? I decided to place my ear ON the wall this time.\\n\\n I wasn’t nervous at this point because there could be a very rational explanation for why a house full of machinery and electricity was vibrating through the walls. I wasn’t nervous that is, until I heard the heartbeat.\\n\\nIt was very distinct. The bump bump...bump bump. It startled me to hear this coming from my wall. I jumped back, knocking my milk over and almost my stool. At first I thought I might’ve just imagined it but when I leaned in to listen again it was the same as before bump bump...bump bump. Confused and a little frightened I went to grab a towel for the milk. After I cleaned and gathered my thoughts I came up with an explanation that there was an animal living in my wall. I mean... the vibrations could just mean the animal was moving and since me and Katherine both felt it, there were probably just a few creatures scurrying about. \\n\\nI talked to Katherine and she recommended calling an exterminator the next day but I had plans the entire afternoon. But...it was fine right? Boy was I wrong. The one day that I was out was the one day that I shouldn’t have been. \\n\\nBy the time I got home from my long day of shopping and visiting my parents it was 10:40. I did my usual, putting groceries away, taking a shower and eating but then I noticed that something didn’t feel right. As I was sitting in bed on my phone I couldn’t help but feel that I was being stalked. Not just watched but like intense staring wherever I was. I went to the bathroom then walked back but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I texted my mom but she had apparently already gone to bed, so I instead texted Katherine. She told me that she had been in a situation like this before and all she had to do was get on a call with someone so that if there was actually someone there they wouldn’t try anything, and it worked. \\n\\nI decided to just FaceTime Katherine because we were already talking and she was a night owl like me. We talked for a few minutes just about past funny moments to make me feel better and then I realized what was wrong, well might be wrong. I hadn’t felt the vibrations when I got home. Maybe the animals had left? “Wait Katherine I think the animals are gone because-“ I looked back at the screen but Katherine’s face had gone pale. “What’s...wrong?” I asked forgetting about my situation for a second. “Don’t freak out...but there’s goo coming out of the wall.” I turned around expecting nothing but instead saw a trail of cloudy yellowish goo coming from a tiny hole in the wall. I scooted forward disgusted by the sight. It dripped down pretty slowly like slime would. “I wonder...” I said out loud. I stepped off my bed and felt the vibrations stronger than I had ever felt them. I walked over to the wall and put my hand on it. It was even stronger here and this time it FELT like a heartbeat. I put my ear up to the wall but didn’t hear anything until I thought I heard a light scratching noise from my bed. I turned and that’s when the pounding started. Louder and louder it got. I could see the wall behind my bed moving. “What’s happening?!” I could hear Katherine yell through the phone. \\n\\nIt all happened at once. The wall pushed forward and a large crack formed. Then it happened again. Then on the 3rd time it broke open. Thank goodness I was on the other side of the room because a giant chunk of the wall came crashing onto my bed, crushing my phone under it. I watched in pure horror as spiny, bony creatures came screeching out of the wall, covered in ooze, blood, and tiny bits of eggshell.', 'author_fullname': 't2_4p9wduqj', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'The bugs that came from the wall [Part 1]', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/nosleep', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'flair-series', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fh78r7', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 14, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Series', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 14, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': ['writing'], 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1584000668.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.nosleep', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs that came from the wall.

I mean... the vibrations could just mean the animal was moving and since me and Katherine both felt it, there were probably just a few creatures scurrying about. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to Katherine and she recommended calling an exterminator the next day but I had plans the entire afternoon. But...it was fine right? Boy was I wrong. The one day that I was out was the one day that I shouldn’t have been. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I got home from my long day of shopping and visiting my parents it was 10:40. I did my usual, putting groceries away, taking a shower and eating but then I noticed that something didn’t feel right. As I was sitting in bed on my phone I couldn’t help but feel that I was being stalked. Not just watched but like intense staring wherever I was. I went to the bathroom then walked back but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I texted my mom but she had apparently already gone to bed, so I instead texted Katherine. She told me that she had been in a situation like this before and all she had to do was get on a call with someone so that if there was actually someone there they wouldn’t try anything, and it worked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to just FaceTime Katherine because we were already talking and she was a night owl like me. We talked for a few minutes just about past funny moments to make me feel better and then I realized what was wrong, well might be wrong. I hadn’t felt the vibrations when I got home. Maybe the animals had left? “Wait Katherine I think the animals are gone because-“ I looked back at the screen but Katherine’s face had gone pale. “What’s...wrong?” I asked forgetting about my situation for a second. “Don’t freak out...but there’s goo coming out of the wall.” I turned around expecting nothing but instead saw a trail of cloudy yellowish goo coming from a tiny hole in the wall. I scooted forward disgusted by the sight. It dripped down pretty slowly like slime would. “I wonder...” I said out loud. I stepped off my bed and felt the vibrations stronger than I had ever felt them. I walked over to the wall and put my hand on it. It was even stronger here and this time it FELT like a heartbeat. I put my ear up to the wall but didn’t hear anything until I thought I heard a light scratching noise from my bed. I turned and that’s when the pounding started. Louder and louder it got. I could see the wall behind my bed moving. “What’s happening?!” I could hear Katherine yell through the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all happened at once. The wall pushed forward and a large crack formed. Then it happened again. Then on the 3rd time it broke open. Thank goodness I was on the other side of the room because a giant chunk of the wall came crashing onto my bed, crushing my phone under it. I watched in pure horror as spiny, bony creatures came screeching out of the wall, covered in ooze, blood, and tiny bits of eggshell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': True, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '8beec82a-dcc1-11e8-a09f-0e09eae1a1c0', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rm4d', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'fh78r7', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'littlesilenteyes', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 1, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/nosleep/comments/fh78r7/the_bugs_that_came_from_the_wall_part_1/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fh78r7/the_bugs_that_came_from_the_wall_part_1/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 13840592, 'created_utc': 1583971868.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'selftext': ' “We’ll put you up in a different dorm block, if that’s OK.

After five thousand four hundred and forty previous subjects, we finally achieved our goal. We cured the common cold. The strain we inoculated 5441 with was a specially engineered strain of the common cold dubbed “Brutus.” Doctor McNamara named it that due to how we developed the strain. It was meant to lie dormant in the walls of blood vessels until the patient contracted a common cold, at which point the Brutus Strain would awaken and turn on the cold, overriding the virus and turning it harmless and benign. The now harmless cold would be flushed out of the body through the body’s own natural functions. We infected the virus with our own virus. Every test subject before was a failure. But on every test subject we used a different “angle of attack.” On 5441, however, it was initially overwhelmingly successful.\\n\\nWe first inoculated 5441 with the Brutus strain and waited fourteen days for the strain to incubate and prime itself. After the waiting period, we injected 5441 with the common cold. It was a fast acting strain but not particularly vicious. 5441 displayed the symptoms of the cold for a short period of time, he sneezed once, but within two hours he looked and felt fine. A blood test confirmed the Brutus strain was active and the cold was being neutralized. An hour later, 5441 began sweating and urinating heavily. These were symptoms, we believed, of the cold being flushed from the body. Nevertheless, we kept 5441 in quarantine overnight. \\n\\nI don’t know how we were able to move straight into human testing. Perhaps it was simply because we were working with nothing more than the common cold. After all, it wasn’t like we were working with smallpox or West Nile. Perhaps it was because, despite sharing almost 99% of our genetic makeup, there was enough of a difference that testing on chimpanzees would not have given us accurate or reliable data. We should have taken that precaution nevertheless. \\n\\nThe next morning we discovered irregularities in subject 5441’s sleep monitoring system. Throughout the night, 5441 displayed a high, irregular heartbeat and his sheets were soaked in sweat. Perhaps he had suffered from a nightmare. But upon interviewing him, he could not recall any nightmares. And he persisted sweating. Another blood test revealed the cold virus had indeed been neutralized and flushed from the body. Yet the Brutus strain was still active. This was entirely unexpected. We had designed Brutus to cling to the blood vessel walls and become dormant once it’s job was done, only to be reactivated once a different cold virus entered the body. We had also designed the virus to be harmless to humans, having no effect on the body or its systems. After the jubilation of what appeared to be a resounding success the previous day, this was an unexpected and disappointing setback. Yet we carried on with further testing, arrogant, certain that this setback could easily be rectified. Even when test subject 5441 began bleeding from his nose, we did not begin to grasp the gravity of our failure. \\n\\nThe next day, test subject 5441’s health had deteriorated a staggering amount. He complained of an intense, aching pain in his stomach, joints, and muscles. His breathing had become rapid. His skin, still clammy with sweat, appeared bloated as if air had been pumped just beneath its surface. His blood vessels appeared strained and overinflated beneath his skin. The nose bleed had not yet ceased. When we tried to draw more blood and run more tests he refused and resisted to the verge of violence, lashing out at us. We had to call in security to restrain him. Once restrained, we discovered his eyes had become extremely bloodshot. This minor setback was becoming an abstract failure. \\n\\nWe managed to draw more blood and other fluids for tests. The Brutus strain had gone from active to malevolent. Under the microscope, we could see the virus attacking and destroying white blood cells. What it did to red blood cells, however, was terrifying, but somehow also extraordinary. It would inject itself into the red blood cell, duplicate itself, and somehow rapidly accelerate the blood cells own growth and division. The incredibly high red blood cell count explained many of his symptoms such as the joint pain, strained blood vessels, and rapid breathing. But that was just the beginning. \\n\\nFrom the lab, we heard a scream from 5441’s quarantine cell. When we arrived we found 5441 sitting upright, unbuckling his leg restraints. A nurse was sitting in the corner crying and clutching her face. The nurse had just drawn more of his blood when 5441 had dislocated his own thumbs in order to slip out of the arm restraints, grab the syringe from the nurse, and jam it into her eye socket. She was now infected with the Brutus strain. 5441’s face had become almost purple in color, his veins and arteries strained and swollen beneath his skin. Blood flowed freely, not only from his nose, but now his eyes as well. His profuse sweating continued. His restraints undone, he lunged at us like an animal, knocking us to the ground. He leaped out the open door and sprinted down the hall. I slammed the emergency button on the wall and a siren blared, red lights flashing everywhere. In the lab there was a freezer which kept glass “pucks” with cultures of every strain we had yet worked with, including Brutus. They were flash frozen to nearly zero kelvin. If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. \\n\\nSecurity arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. \\n\\nThe facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. \\n\\nThe other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”\\n\\nTrying desperately to calm my nerves, I spoke smoothly and soothingly. I tried to talk him down, tried to talk him into putting the puck back into the freezer. I took a step forward. Wrong move. In an instant, he dropped the puck and it shattered on the ground. The guards lunged and tackled him. Pinning him on his stomach, they cuffed him. He was screaming incoherently, foam and spittle flying from his mouth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the virus culture fizzing on the ground. It was airborne. We are all infected. The guards tried hauling 5441 to his feet. As they did so, 5441 let out one last guttural scream. With a horrific sound like the slap of a wet towel, his body opened up. His abdomen, arms, and legs split open at unseen seems. His eyes burst like grapes. Blood flowed out of his ruined and shredded body like a satanic baptism. The floor became slick with the ungodly amount of blood from 5441. And that was it. Silence fell. We are all infected. \\n\\nIn writing this I am violating every non-disclosure agreement I signed for the company. Not that I care anymore. Code black protocol was initiated four minutes ago. It would take another three minutes for the jets and bombers to arrive and deliver their payload of brimstone and hellfire. There will be no lawsuit or legal action taken against me once by body is atomized by the military. There will also be no bloated paycheck, no Nobel prize for me. Now I sit in the control room with my colleagues. I am resigned to the fate of fire that comes for me. I am just hopeful the bombing neutralizes every molecule of this place. The virus cannot escape. It’s ironic, the name McNamara gave to the virus. Brutus. He named it so because we designed it to turn on and destroy other virus strains of its kind. But it turned on us, it’s creators, instead. How ironic.  \\n\\nOver the wails of the infected guard, I can hear the roar of jet engines in the distance. A squadron of fighter bombers, loaded with incendiary ordinance, is near. Soon fire will rain from them like the wrath of God. And with that, I hope, the threat of this virus will end.

After five thousand four hundred and forty previous subjects, we finally achieved our goal. We cured the common cold. The strain we inoculated 5441 with was a specially engineered strain of the common cold dubbed “Brutus.” Doctor McNamara named it that due to how we developed the strain. It was meant to lie dormant in the walls of blood vessels until the patient contracted a common cold, at which point the Brutus Strain would awaken and turn on the cold, overriding the virus and turning it harmless and benign. The now harmless cold would be flushed out of the body through the body’s own natural functions. We infected the virus with our own virus. Every test subject before was a failure. But on every test subject we used a different “angle of attack.” On 5441, however, it was initially overwhelmingly successful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We first inoculated 5441 with the Brutus strain and waited fourteen days for the strain to incubate and prime itself. After the waiting period, we injected 5441 with the common cold. It was a fast acting strain but not particularly vicious. 5441 displayed the symptoms of the cold for a short period of time, he sneezed once, but within two hours he looked and felt fine. A blood test confirmed the Brutus strain was active and the cold was being neutralized. An hour later, 5441 began sweating and urinating heavily. These were symptoms, we believed, of the cold being flushed from the body. Nevertheless, we kept 5441 in quarantine overnight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how we were able to move straight into human testing. Perhaps it was simply because we were working with nothing more than the common cold. After all, it wasn’t like we were working with smallpox or West Nile. Perhaps it was because, despite sharing almost 99% of our genetic makeup, there was enough of a difference that testing on chimpanzees would not have given us accurate or reliable data. We should have taken that precaution nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning we discovered irregularities in subject 5441’s sleep monitoring system. Throughout the night, 5441 displayed a high, irregular heartbeat and his sheets were soaked in sweat. Perhaps he had suffered from a nightmare. But upon interviewing him, he could not recall any nightmares. And he persisted sweating. Another blood test revealed the cold virus had indeed been neutralized and flushed from the body. Yet the Brutus strain was still active. This was entirely unexpected. We had designed Brutus to cling to the blood vessel walls and become dormant once it’s job was done, only to be reactivated once a different cold virus entered the body. We had also designed the virus to be harmless to humans, having no effect on the body or its systems. After the jubilation of what appeared to be a resounding success the previous day, this was an unexpected and disappointing setback. Yet we carried on with further testing, arrogant, certain that this setback could easily be rectified. Even when test subject 5441 began bleeding from his nose, we did not begin to grasp the gravity of our failure. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, test subject 5441’s health had deteriorated a staggering amount. He complained of an intense, aching pain in his stomach, joints, and muscles. His breathing had become rapid. His skin, still clammy with sweat, appeared bloated as if air had been pumped just beneath its surface. His blood vessels appeared strained and overinflated beneath his skin. The nose bleed had not yet ceased. When we tried to draw more blood and run more tests he refused and resisted to the verge of violence, lashing out at us. We had to call in security to restrain him. Once restrained, we discovered his eyes had become extremely bloodshot. This minor setback was becoming an abstract failure. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We managed to draw more blood and other fluids for tests. The Brutus strain had gone from active to malevolent. Under the microscope, we could see the virus attacking and destroying white blood cells. What it did to red blood cells, however, was terrifying, but somehow also extraordinary. It would inject itself into the red blood cell, duplicate itself, and somehow rapidly accelerate the blood cells own growth and division. The incredibly high red blood cell count explained many of his symptoms such as the joint pain, strained blood vessels, and rapid breathing. But that was just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From the lab, we heard a scream from 5441’s quarantine cell. When we arrived we found 5441 sitting upright, unbuckling his leg restraints. A nurse was sitting in the corner crying and clutching her face. The nurse had just drawn more of his blood when 5441 had dislocated his own thumbs in order to slip out of the arm restraints, grab the syringe from the nurse, and jam it into her eye socket. She was now infected with the Brutus strain. 5441’s face had become almost purple in color, his veins and arteries strained and swollen beneath his skin. Blood flowed freely, not only from his nose, but now his eyes as well. His profuse sweating continued. His restraints undone, he lunged at us like an animal, knocking us to the ground. He leaped out the open door and sprinted down the hall. I slammed the emergency button on the wall and a siren blared, red lights flashing everywhere. In the lab there was a freezer which kept glass “pucks” with cultures of every strain we had yet worked with, including Brutus. They were flash frozen to nearly zero kelvin. If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Security arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying desperately to calm my nerves, I spoke smoothly and soothingly. I tried to talk him down, tried to talk him into putting the puck back into the freezer. I took a step forward. Wrong move. In an instant, he dropped the puck and it shattered on the ground. The guards lunged and tackled him. Pinning him on his stomach, they cuffed him. He was screaming incoherently, foam and spittle flying from his mouth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the virus culture fizzing on the ground. It was airborne. We are all infected. The guards tried hauling 5441 to his feet. As they did so, 5441 let out one last guttural scream. With a horrific sound like the slap of a wet towel, his body opened up. His abdomen, arms, and legs split open at unseen seems. His eyes burst like grapes. Blood flowed out of his ruined and shredded body like a satanic baptism. The floor became slick with the ungodly amount of blood from 5441. And that was it. Silence fell. We are all infected. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In writing this I am violating every non-disclosure agreement I signed for the company. Not that I care anymore. Code black protocol was initiated four minutes ago. It would take another three minutes for the jets and bombers to arrive and deliver their payload of brimstone and hellfire. There will be no lawsuit or legal action taken against me once by body is atomized by the military. There will also be no bloated paycheck, no Nobel prize for me. Now I sit in the control room with my colleagues. I am resigned to the fate of fire that comes for me. I am just hopeful the bombing neutralizes every molecule of this place. The virus cannot escape. It’s ironic, the name McNamara gave to the virus. Brutus. He named it so because we designed it to turn on and destroy other virus strains of its kind. But it turned on us, it’s creators, instead. How ironic.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the wails of the infected guard, I can hear the roar of jet engines in the distance. A squadron of fighter bombers, loaded with incendiary ordinance, is near. Soon fire will rain from them like the wrath of God. And with that, I hope, the threat of this virus will end.

       "   'selftext': \"I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering [how badly things went last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/).  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))\\n\\nThe old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly *anyone* right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  \\n\\nFor the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.\\n\\nIt wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.\\n\\nI don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.\\n\\nI accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.\\n\\nStupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.\\n\\nI wasn’t even *pretending* to be angry.\\n\\nIt hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?\\n\\nYeah.  I fucked up.\\n\\nThere were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged *that* fight Bryan took over running errands for me.\\n\\nI wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.\\n\\nWe would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.\\n\\nI went to see the man with no shadow.\\n\\nA significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t *actually* believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.\\n\\nThe weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.\\n\\nI skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.\\n\\nHe watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.\\n\\n“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”\\n\\nHe dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.\\n\\n“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.\\n\\nI dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.\\n\\n“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”\\n\\nThe man with no shadow laughed.  \\n\\n“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”\\n\\nHe walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.\\n\\n“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.\\n\\nThen he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. \\n\\nI cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.\\n\\n“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re *desperate*.”\\n\\n“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.\\n\\n“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”\\n\\nHe gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.\\n\\n“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”\\n\\nThe threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t *actually* want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nIt all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.\\n\\n“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.\\n\\n“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”\\n\\nHe smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was *very* tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.\\n\\n“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”\\n\\nHe laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.\\n\\nAnd then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.\\n\\nI’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.\\n\\nThe rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.\\n\\nUnless, of course, someone killed him.\\n\\nWhat a shame that would be.\\n\\nSince I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.\\n\\nThere was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.\\n\\n“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”\\n\\n“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”\\n\\nI froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I *would* have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.\\n\\nHe sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.\\n\\n“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let *me* refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”\\n\\nHis voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  \\n\\nDid I do this to him? \\n\\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.\\n\\nThe man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.\\n\\n“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”\\n\\nI had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.\\n\\nBut the not-brother sure as hell is.\\n\\nI called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.\\n\\n“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”\\n\\nAnd then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.\\n\\n“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”\\n\\nMessy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what *I* was.\\n\\nYes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.\\n\\nI hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.\\n\\nI slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.\\n\\nKicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.\\n\\nThe not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was *normal*.\\n\\nMaybe it is, around here.\\n\\nI don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.\\n\\nI stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.\\n\\n“That is *not* your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”\\n\\n“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a *concussion* recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”\\n\\nThe old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.\\n\\nThe force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.\\n\\nSee?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.\\n\\nBut now…\\n\\nThey all saw him for what he was.\\n\\n“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t *like* being around humans.  I don’t *like* pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”\\n\\nHe knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.\\n\\nI felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.\\n\\nAnd it didn’t matter.\\n\\nHe called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.\\n\\nI’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.\\n\\nGuns and dogs.\\n\\nAnd Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.\\n\\nThe not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.\\n\\nThe knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.\\n\\nThe room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.\\n\\nI held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.\\n\\nThen I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  \\n\\nThey’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.\\n\\nI’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.\\n\\nI guess it doesn’t matter now.\\n\\nI trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.  The family specialty.\\n\\n[Read the full list of rules.](https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat/comments/cm2hov/how_to_survive_camping_the_full_list_of_rules/)\\n\\n[Visit the campground's website.](https://goatvalleycampgrounds.com/)\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a private campground.  Though it felt like I wouldn’t for much longer, considering &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fe4qxm/how_to_survive_camping_the_man_with_the_skull_cup/\"&gt;how badly things went last week&lt;/a&gt;.  At least the risks we took have given us some insight on the man with no shadow’s plan.  He intends to replace me with someone that, presumably, is easier to control.  What he wants to do with that influence I am not certain of, but you know what?  I don’t care.  I’m sure it won’t be anything good and I am not going to let him win.  (if you’re new here, you should really &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/\"&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff came up with a plan to kill the not-brother.  He sent it to me via text so that he wouldn’t be seen at my house too much and so he couldn’t be overheard on the phone.  He doesn’t trust hardly &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; right now, which I think is prudent.  This is one advantage we have over the man with no shadow: technology.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first step, we needed to convince the man with no shadow that he had me cornered.  That I was too afraid to leave my campground and that my fear was causing me to drive people away.  The concussion had already helped with that, as I was still largely confined to my home and was relying on the old sheriff and Bryan to bring me things I needed, like groceries.  The sheriff’s idea was to stage a highly visible blow-up at one of my staff.  Yell at them over something trivial.  Make it look like I was stressed to the point that any little thing would set off a collapse.  I was still considering which staff member to target - who would be the most resilient to being unexpectedly yelled at - when my brother came over to check on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an intentional change of plans.  It just… sort of happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t like making our internal drama public.  Due to the nature of what we do around here we tend to keep our problems to ourselves and we certainly don’t involve outsiders.  But I’ve told you some personal things already and maybe it’s only fair that I tell you this as well, no matter how ashamed I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I accused my brother of being the black sheep.  The one distributing the flyers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stupid, I know, but I wasn’t thinking straight or maybe it was the pain meds.  We finally got some that were safe from another town.  Anyway, the comment that the man with no shadow’s proxy had made was eating at me, how he insinuated my brother would be willing to sell the campground.  I was feeling a little testy when he visited - not at him, just at the situation in general - but he wound up being the person I blew up at and things escalated and I made the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be angry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt him pretty bad, I think.  Of course it would.  Your own sister saying that you’re behind stirring up the town to the point it’s trying to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a couple other incidents we orchestrated, nice and visible, to demonstrate that perhaps Kate wasn’t keeping it together after all.  The old sheriff was convinced that I was being watched - the man with no shadow would be a fool not to - and so after a few more “meltdowns” we could be confident that word had gotten back to him.  One of those scenes was at the old sheriff and after we staged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fight Bryan took over running errands for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t as confident in our plan as the old sheriff was.  There was one additional assurance that I wanted.  I didn’t tell him what I planned to do.  He would deem it too risky.  He might have tried to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We would have fought for real, if that happened.  I will sometimes listen to suggestions but I do not take kindly to being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see the man with no shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A significant risk, especially after he tried to kill me with the car accident.  I admit that I was afraid.  The only reason I tried was because I believed that killing me meant that he’d have to convince my brother to sell instead.  I guess I don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe he’s the black sheep.  It’s just my brother’s resolve is an unknown quality, even to me.  If the man with no shadow thought I was on the edge of collapse… then leaving me alive would be the fastest and easiest route to what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weather was mild that day, so I wore a shirt with a low collar so that the discoloration on my neck was clearly visible.  It’s purple and yellow with spots of magenta-red, blotches that cover the entirety of one side of my neck, down onto my collarbones, with lingering patches on my jaw.  The blood under my skin is slowly dispersing, traveling down my body from the pull of gravity.  It’s tender but it doesn’t hurt like it did.  The swelling has come down immensely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped my pain meds that morning.  The less acting I had to do, the better.  Then I took my shotgun and went out into the woods.  I went to the grove where the man with no shadow lives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He watched me approach, sitting on a large stone, one bare foot tucked up close to his body, the other stretched out to touch the grass.  He conspicuously eyed my gun a moment and then lazily glanced up to meet my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fancy another try at me?” he asked.  “Good timing - I was feeling peckish.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his eyes down to the shadow at my feet and slowly smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m here to negotiate,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dredged up the memory of the pain of having my shadow torn apart.  How I’d collapsed, screaming.  I let my voice tremble.  His smile deepened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You want off this land,” I continued.  “I’ll release you if you promise to leave.  And to take the not-brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with no shadow laughed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” he sighed, hopping off the stone.  “Oh Kate.  I thought you were smarter than this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked towards me.  I hoisted my shotgun, letting my hands shake, and he hesitated only briefly at the edge of his grove.  Then slowly, deliberately, he stepped out of his territory and continued to advance towards me.  I pointed the gun at him and he paused, barely a foot away from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what I want,” he murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he jerked a hand up, so quickly I might not have been able to react if I weren’t expecting it.  It was an effort to not squeeze the trigger.  I almost did.  My hand twitched reflexively but I fought the urge down and let him grab the gun and rip it out of my hands.  He tossed it aside onto the forest floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried out in surprise and stepped backwards but he wasn’t letting me escape.  He lunged forwards, grabbed the front of my shirt, twisting the fabric between his fingers, and he pulled me close.  I was forced to tilt my head back to look up into his eyes and the bruises on my neck were clearly visible.  He traced them, with one finger of his free hand, and I did not have to pretend as I trembled in fear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe you’re not being stupid,” he said, his finger stopping just at the edge of the cut across my lower lip.  “Maybe you’re &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The not-brother almost killed me,” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that the closest you’ve come to dying?  Poor thing.  Humans aren’t really cut out for this sort of thing.  Wouldn’t it be a relief to let it all go?  Is your family’s legacy worth this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gently brushed a lock of my hair behind my ear, the tenderness of the gesture offset by how tightly he still held my shirt, pinning me in place.  I shuddered and he seemed pleased by my reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have… some… authority over the not-brother,” he said, studying my face.  I dropped my head and avoided eye contact.  “I can tell him to stop trying to kill you.  Give you a little peace in which to make your decision.  But Kate… he is my subordinate, not my slave.  Wait too long and I may not be able to restrain him entirely, nor the town.  They won’t kill you, but neither will they leave you… intact.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The threat was not unexpected.  Even though I’d mentally prepared myself for this, on the walk to the grove, I still felt sick hearing the words and understanding their full implication.  My words stuck in my throat and I was unable to reply.  The man with no shadow took this to mean I was truly cowed - and perhaps in that moment I was - and said that he would tell the not-brother to spare my life.  As a gesture of kindness.  He didn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; want me dead, after all.  That wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all sounded very convincing and I think without the lady’s tea, I would have believed every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t understand why you want to destroy my campground,” I said, finally finding my voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to understand.  You just have to do what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled broadly and patted me on the check.  Then he let go of my shirt and briskly walked away, casually putting his back to me.  I eyed the distance between myself and the shotgun.  I admit it was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tempting.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to gamble all of this on having better reflexes than him, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This was a good talk,” he called back to me.  “It was nice to have an actual conversation for once.  Maybe I’ll visit the lady in the woods and give her my thanks for supplying you with the tea.  And then I’ll kill her, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed.  That was enough for me.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  I scooped up the shotgun and turned to leave, walking quickly, eager to put the sound of his laughter behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then a townhall meeting was called,  just as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that the not-brother is actually not that clever on its own and the man with no shadow is the real brains of the operation here.  After all, it tried to integrate itself with my campground directly first, thereby putting it in close proximity to the people most familiar with monsters.  (though if a commenter hadn’t pointed out the discrepancies, I wonder if it would have succeeded)  Regardless, for how easily it seems to have taken over the town, I feel it would have had more luck with… whatever its goals are… by starting there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rally had stirred up the town enough to ensure a good turnout at the meeting.  It was likely that almost everyone would be there.  All the not-brother had to do was go out in front of them and introduce himself and they would all be his.  Everyone in town that was undecided or still on my side - they would be his.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, someone killed him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What a shame that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was without a car the plan was that Bryan would pick me up shortly before the meeting was scheduled to start.  The old sheriff was already in position.  I’m not sure what it says about him that he knows how to get a good angle on the town hall with a scoped rifle, but I’m glad he’s on our side.  I was armed with the pistol and shotgun.  Certainly, they hadn’t done a whole lot to the not-brother the first time, but I only needed to make a symbolic gesture.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a knock at my door as I sat waiting.  Startled, I grabbed my shotgun and hurried to answer, surprised that I hadn’t heard Bryan’s truck pull up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup was on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, this is a bad time,” I finally said after a long moment of awkward silence.  “Can we talk about that kiss some other day?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you think I came here to talk about that?  Perhaps I am here because of how you tried to refuse my offer of a drink.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, like every muscle in my body was shot through with ice, locked up in terror.  Some part of my brain gibbered that I was going to die - horribly - and while I heard what he said next, I didn’t register the words.  Not until he said my name to get my attention and repeated himself.  He wasn’t going to kill me, not after all he’d done to keep me alive.  But I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to atone for my mistakes - and there had been many as of late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed and traced the rim of the cup with one finger, his eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I told you not to empty the cup,” he murmured.  “It is easy enough to refill when it runs low.  Refilling it when it is emptied is another matter.  I honestly would have preferred you have returned it empty and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; refill it, as I could have managed it properly.  But what’s done is done and now you need to finish what you started.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His voice sounded weary and this time, it wasn’t the condescending exhaustion he adopted when I was - in his opinion - being dense.  I peered at him intently, noting how stark his cheekbones were and the shadows under his eyes.  He looked… gaunt.  Pale.  Like he’s sick.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do this to him? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me dead in the eyes and with a flat, emotionless stare that never wavered from my face, he turned the cup sideways until the liquid spilled out and puddled on the porch.  He tilted the cup upright before the last few drops fell.  Blood from what was already there.  Then he lifted his hand to his mouth and bit carefully down on a knuckle.  The skin split open and brilliant drops of blood beaded up.  He tipped his hand so that they collected together and spilled out and into the cup.  Blood freely given.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man with the skull cup handed it to me, along with his knife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blood of an enemy, forcibly taken,” he said.  “Don’t screw it up this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the right idea but the wrong source.  The sheriff was never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the not-brother sure as hell is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called up the old sheriff and told him there was a change in the plan.  He didn’t like it, but grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The town isn’t going to like how you’re handling this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My family isn’t here to be their friends,” I replied.  “We’re here to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then Bryan was there, the back of his pickup truck loaded with large dogs, and I climbed into the passenger side and buckled myself in.  He asked where my gun was and I told him about the change in plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be messy,” he sighed, backing the car out of the driveway.  “I can’t promise the dogs won’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Messy was fine.  Maybe a veritable bloodbath would remind the town exactly what they were dealing with.  Both what my campground was… and what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m trying to save people now instead of letting them suffer the consequences of their choices, but that doesn’t mean they can just forget that I’m willing to slit my share of throats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the sight of the town hall, after my uncle’s death.  My heart sped up as Bryan parked within eyeshot of the building.  I took a shallow breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm myself, and then gave up on that.  Screw it.  I didn’t need to be calm.  I needed to be angry.  Anger had carried me through every hard thing I’d done, whether it was just or not, and it would carry me through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door of the pickup truck behind me.  The dogs watched me go, lined up at the edge of the pickup’s bed with their tongues hanging out.  I walked alone to the closed doors of the town hall, took a breath, and then shouldered them bodily open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kicking them open would have made a more impressive entrance, sure, but I didn’t want to risk spilling the contents of the cup I carried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother stood behind the podium at the fore of the room.  Beside him was the buyer.  My unwitting cousin looked nervous, his eyes wide and his forehead shining with sweat.  He seemed ready to bolt at any moment and for a brief second he looked relieved for the interruption.  Then he saw the knife in my hand and he went pale.  Opened his mouth to say something, perhaps to yell for someone to call the police, and then that died when he realized that no one else was moving - like this was &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is, around here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s under the control of the man with no shadow.  It’s a hunch, but I feel pretty good about it.  He looked too afraid there, standing at the front of the room and realizing that someone was bearing down on them with murder in her eyes and not a soul was lifting a finger to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped halfway to the not-brother, who had not moved from the podium.  He stared at me in shock.  Clearly our gamble had paid off, for he did not expect me to be here.  I raised the knife and pointed the tip at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your friend,” I said in a clear voice that carried easily throughout the room.  “That is an abomination, not much different from all the other monsters that I keep trapped on my land so that you all can sleep safely in your beds at night.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Kate,” the not-brother sighed.  “Didn’t you get a &lt;em&gt;concussion&lt;/em&gt; recently?  Maybe you should see your doctor about these… outbursts you’ve been having lately.  Is your brother speaking to you again yet?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The old sheriff had picked up some things during his tenure.  Things about surveillance.  And he’d wired up the podium so that he could listen in to what was being said while he was in his sniper position.  At the moment when the not-brother paused, before anyone in the room could react, a bullet came through the window and into the side of the not-brother’s head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The force of it knocked him over.  My cousin - the buyer - shrieked and threw himself to the ground.  The rest of the room stirred, some stood, and the police that were present to maintain general order put their hands on their guns, their attention fixed on where I stood waiting.  Then everyone went still and silent again as the not-brother slowly picked himself up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;See?  Stupid.  He could have just played dead long enough for the police to escort me out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They all saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he snarled, blood dripping down from the bullet hole in the side of his head.  “FINE.  This plan was annoying, anyways.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; being around humans.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pretending to be your friend.  I just… want… to FEED.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knocked the podium aside with one sweep of his arm.  It smashed sideways to the floor.  People were on their feet now, someone screamed, and they bolted to the edges of the room, crowding near the walls, desperate to get away from the creature that was stalking down the aisle to where I stood.  His empty abdomen stretched wide, ribs dripping with fluid, and I saw raw hunger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt elated.  They saw him for what he was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called to them and they came, turning over chairs in their haste, eyes maddened and empty.  I saw the intention in their mindless stares as they rolled across the room in a wave of human flesh.  They would tear me apart and feed me to their master, whose words poisoned their minds and overrode their senses and turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with plenty of monsters on my land.  We have a simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guns and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Bryan’s hounds came in through the door, throwing them fully open with the impact of their body weight, and they rolled past me in a black, angry pack of fur and fangs.  They hit the line of people closing in on me, a heavy collision of muscle and fur into flesh and they all went down, a veritable barricade of flailing and fighting.  There were screams - I couldn’t tell if it was rage or pain - for the dogs had cleared a pathway between me and the not-brother and I was running forwards.  They’d stopped the mob just short of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The not-brother ran to meet me, arms spread low to his side, ready to pull me into the void of his abdomen.  I gripped the knife tight.  And just before we collided, the old sheriff took his second shot, and the not-brother’s knee exploded into red ruin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The knife went up and into his chin as he fell.  He landed hard in front of me, his body held up by one knee and the strength of my arm, his head twisted back as he dangled from the blade, gurgling as blood flooded his mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet.  Even the people that were on the ground, pinned under the weight of the dogs, subsided into muffled whimpering.  They stopped trying to get to me.  They just stared, wide-eyed, breathing fast, and anything they might have said to one another was drowned out by the desperate choking of the not-brother.  Then that, too, went quiet, replaced by the steady drip of blood onto the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I held the cup under the wound until it was full.  Blood of my enemy, forcibly taken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ripped the knife free and let his body fall to the ground.  And I left.  Behind me, the dogs turned their attention to the corpse.  They savaged it, ripping into it and tearing the skin from muscle, severing tendons, pulling the bones free.  Someone was quietly sick in the corner of the room.  I didn’t care.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d made a deal with the devil.  They shouldn’t be surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a campground manager.  I’m not very clever and there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.  I think the man with no shadow has underestimated me, however.  He only trusts what he can control and this leads him to use people as tools and then to discard them as soon as they aren’t useful.  I wonder if the not-brother realized this or if he thought he could stay useful for as long as it took to get what the man with no shadow had promised him.  The campground as his own personal hunting grounds, no doubt, once it was no longer in my possession.  I wonder if the man with no shadow would have betrayed him before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it doesn’t matter now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I trust the old sheriff.  I trust Bryan.  And though I question his motives… I trust that the man with the skull cup will help to keep me alive.  I returned his knife and cup.  He took them and then raised the cup to his lips and drank.  Then he nodded at me, faintly, and walked away.  So I guess I did it right this time and I guess he’s going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ll be able to trick the man with no shadow again.  He’ll be wise to it now, realizing that I’m not such a simple creature; that I, too, am capable of deceit.  I’m okay with this.  I’m not interested in playing his game.  I’m bad at it.  We’re going to play my game instead and that game is just good old fashioned violence.

       "   'selftext': \"42 years, 6 months and 3 days ago, on the 5th of September 1977, a space probe was launched from Earth, and sent on an endless journey through space. The probe, which was affectionately named Voyager 1, contains a multitude of information regarding humanity, including our language, our art, and in a more metaphorical way; Our souls.  \\n\\n\\nToday, the little machine is 22 billion kilometers away from Earth, the furthest reach of our species, though not a manned vessel, it's still a part of us. Despite its distance, we're still keeping contact with it, and during it's journey spanning almost half a century, it has given us an insight into the mysteries of the universe we thought we could only dream about. \\n\\n\\nMy own father spent most of his life on the project, and I have since followed in his footsteps. I dreamed about taking over his work even as a twelve year old kid, and eventually, these dreams would land me at NASA's doorstep.\\n\\n\\nLittle did I know, that only a few years into my work, the one question that has plagued us since the dawn of mankind, would be answered, forever changing the course of human history. \\n\\n\\n“Are we alone?”\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nOn the 7th of December 2019, I arrived to the office after having been called in at four in the morning. I immediately noticed the panic that had erupted over night, with my coworkers scurrying around the office, confused, horrified, but seemingly excited about a picture sent from Voyager 1. \\n\\n\\nThe monitors that usually displayed little more than numbers and boring graphs, now all showed the same, singular image; That of a blue planet. I approached one of the screens, and studied the photograph. In many ways, the planet resembled Earth, with vast blue oceans, and split landmasses, but none of the continents were recognizable to me, and the clouds hovering above were red, with a vague, yellow tint. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, Dan, what's this?” I asked my neighboring coworker. \\n\\n\\nAt first he barely noticed my presence, too engrossed in his own work as he stared at the screen with a mixture of terror and anticipation. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, what's the picture?” I repeated. \\n\\n\\n“It came from Voyager 1,” he said, barely a whisper. \\n\\n\\nIt was a ludicrous statement. The last image sent from Voyager 1 had been received in 1990, the famous ['Pale Blue Dot,'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg) an image we'd posted on the wall of our office for inspiration. Since that fateful day, our engineers turned the camera off to save the probe's memory, assuring we could still receive more valuable data in the future. \\n\\n\\n“Don't be stupid, that's impossible,” I said, “they turned the camera off decades ago.”\\n\\n\\n“Something – something turned it back on,” he said with a shaky voice. \\n\\n\\nHis choice of words confused me. Instead of indicating that a person had done it, he said 'something.'\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean? How is that even possible?”\\n\\n\\n“I don't know, but the signal that turned it on came from the planet on the picture. It overrode the system, effectively hijacking the probe.”\\n\\n\\nI looked back at the picture, noting its bright surface, an impossible image without a nearby star to light it up, but according to all available data, Voyager 1 should have been several light years away from the nearest star.\\n\\n\\n“The signal came from within the Oort cloud,” Dan mumbled. \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n\\n“I know, it's three hundred years ahead of schedule. We rechecked it five times, it doesn't make any sense.”\\n\\n\\nBefore I could ask any further questions, my supervisor called me into the main office. There, he showed me the transmission we'd received from Voyager 1. Apparently it wasn't just the picture, but a sequence of numbers and codes hidden within the radio signal. \\n\\n\\n“Do you know what it means?” I asked after listening to the mess of sounds about ten times. \\n\\n\\n“Well, that's why we called you in. We were hoping your father left behind any ideas about his work, before he passed away.”\\n\\n\\nMy Dad was a magnificent man, brilliant in his own way, but obsessed with finding the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Throughout the past century, Earth has picked up a multitude of different radio signal, most of them just an after effect from collapsing starts and random background radiation. \\n\\n\\nHowever, among the mess of noise, several coherent messages have been filtered out from the symphony of the universe. The only problem was that we had no means with which to translate them. My father never could, he could only determine their origin, which fit perfectly with the current location of Voyager 1.\\n \\n\\nThen it dawned on me, that the last message, coming from Voyager 1, wasn't just another random signal sent from a thus far unknown planet, but a mathematical key that could be used to translate everything we'd received so far. My theory was, that the species that had hijacked the probe, had used it to understand our language, instructions of sorts. \\n\\n\\nWe spent the next few days deciphering the message, desperately looking for the key. It took a lot of sleepless nights, and countless amounts of caffeine, but eventually we found the answer. \\n\\n\\nWithout hesitation, we applied the decoder to all previous messages originating from the same region. The first one having arrived in 1968.\\n\\n\\nThough we had what was essentially an alien dictionary, the language they used contained so many foreign concepts, ideas we still don't understand, but what follows is the basics of what we've deciphered so far:\\n\\n\\nDecember 7th, 1968: “Is there anyone out there?”\\n\\n\\nMarch 15th, 2003: “Help, help, help.”\\n\\n\\nOctober 23rd, 2010: “They are here.”\\n\\n\\nSeptember 19th, 2011: “We did our best, sorry.” \\n\\n\\nThough the direct messages didn't make much sense on their own. The planet had emitted a continuous signal that seemed to contain a very comprehensive history of their world. As far as we could tell, their species first surfaced ten million years ago, and has reached a level of technology that is so far beyond our own, that we can't even begin to understand it. They make no mention of war, but they talked about a defense grid around their system, one that had been ineffective against a threat mentioned on several accounts. The most approximate translation of this threat has been termed “The Iudex.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last distress signal in 2011, their planet fell silent. It was a heartbreaking discovery, to finally find intelligent life other than our own, only to have it extinguished immediately. \\n\\n\\nThe more horrifying fact, however, was that their demise wasn't one of their own making. No, their end had come at the hands of a far superior species, one able to travel through space only to wage war and destruction...\\n\\n\\nYet, despite their end, a final message was sent through Voyager 1. One that wasn't calling for help, or giving us a detailed history, or ideas on how to reach them.\\n\\n\\nInstead, they left us with a final warning, a simple message, and a translation key. All they said was:\\n\\n\\n[“You are next.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daJ0veR9XTw)\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"My cat is acting a bit… off. She’s a rescue so, of course, she’s got a couple kinks to work out. This is a little more than that, though. \\n\\n\\nShe started by scratching the walls, completely disregarding the perfectly good scratching post right next to her. It seemed harmless enough, although they were rather high up the wall. It wouldn’t be any trouble to fix, though. Just a simple matter of repainting. \\n\\n\\nThen, she started pissing on the floors, even though she had a perfectly good litter box that I cleaned daily. And they weren’t just your average, cat-sized urine puddles. These were massive. Impossibly large for the size of my cat. I was perplexed at the size and unsure of how to curb this behavior. I tried doing a google search, checking pet owner forums, but all of the remedies I found didn’t seem to help at all. \\n\\n\\nWas it something I was going to just have to accept and live with? Maybe another way of marking her territory or a strange thing she picked up from the previous owner?\\n\\n\\nI didn’t know anything about the cat before I brought her home. She was pretty small, somewhat malnourished and skittish, but overall seemed to be a pretty loving cat. I figured she came from an abusive or neglectful home. I tried not to think too much about her life before me. As far as I was concerned, she had always been my cat. \\n\\n\\nThen, the night time wailing began. I know what you’re thinking, cats go crazy at night, it’s a known fact. And that is true, but something about the way she meowed. The way she seemed to be calling out to something in groans that sounded more like some sort of lost language than a cat’s meow, that sent shivers down my spine. \\n\\n\\nIt was something that resembled a song. Rhythmic and repeating over and over again, all through the night. I’d just ignore it, forcing myself to lay in bed and accept what was happening just beyond my bedroom door. If I wasn’t able to fall asleep, which seemed like it was just about every night, I’d have a little bit of chemical help in the form of ambien. The magic little sleeping pill that made me go lights-out in 20 minutes, flat. \\n\\n\\nI’d wake up in the morning to dead mice, rats and even rabbits placed just outside of my bedroom door. Not my front door, no. These would be inside my house, sitting right outside my door as I stepped out in the morning to make a cup of coffee. \\n\\n\\nThe first one was unexpected and, naturally, I stepped right on it’s detached head. It crunched beneath my feet, sending brain matter, blood and viscera shooting up between my toes and oozing out of the cracks. I nearly vomited, barely holding it back as I launched myself toward the bathroom. \\n\\n\\nI searched my house up and down for any way she might have been escaping. A cracked window or perhaps the dryer vent wasn’t secured properly. After hours of searching, I came up with nothing. My house was sealed tight. There was no way for her to escape. \\n\\n\\nI thought that maybe she was just doing her job. She was a predator, after all. And she seemed to be a damn good hunter who kept my house free of unwanted critters and pests. \\n\\n\\nI could live with that. \\n\\n\\nI learned to keep an eye out as I exited my bedroom in the morning. Like clockwork, I’d wake up and exit my room at 7am and there they were. Like little gifts, their heads torn clean off their bodies and placed carefully to the side. My cat would simply sit on the armrest of my couch, watching and purring happily. It even looked like she had a little smile on her face. \\n\\n\\nIt was the cutest thing to see her so happy. So proud of herself that she was completing her task so efficiently. \\n\\n\\nThe next gift she left me was a bit bigger. \\n\\n\\nWhen I stepped out of my room, in my normal routine just like any other day, I was greeted by a scene of gruesome horror. Blood splashed on my walls, caked on all my furniture and pooled up just in front of my door. \\n\\n\\nMy arms began shaking with a rush of anxiety that took hold of me and refused to let go. My breath became short and my heart threatened to leap from my chest. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked over at my cat, she seemed pleased, like any other day. She purred happily, staring at me with a Cheshire Cat grin smug on her face. She was coated in bright red blood and had something floppy dangling from her mouth. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked down at the “gift” she had brought me, I nearly collapsed. My legs began to wobble, my vision blurred and a deep seated panic settled in my bones. \\n\\n\\nIt was my neighbor, Bill. He was lying on my floor. Just like every other “gift” she’d left me, he was placed meticulously on the floor with his head torn from his neck. \\n\\n\\nI stared in frozen shock for what seemed like hours. A quick “meow” from my cat brought me back to my senses. \\n\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t able to hold the bile in my stomach. This time, I hurled it out, violently coating Bill's dead body in a thin layer of yellow stomach acid. \\n\\n\\nIt was incomprehensible, inexplicable and inconceivable that my cat could or would do this. I put that aside, though. I had an issue to deal with, and there was no way the authorities would believe that my small little house cat had done something like this.\\n\\n\\nNo one would. \\n\\n\\nAfter scrambling around my house, shutting all the curtains and closing all the blinds, I found myself in a bit of a predicament. The only solution, obviously, was to clean things up. \\n\\n\\nI started with the body. Best to get rid of the big, hulking mass of a man before it started stinking up the place. It wasn’t difficult to get rid of, either. I took a couple trash bags, sealed him up inside and brought him out to my garage. I popped open the trunk of my car and heaved him inside. \\n\\n\\nThe blood and guts were a little more of a challenge. My floors were coated in a thick, slowly hardening layer of bright red, viscous liquid. My couches were definitely ruined. I’d have to get a new living room set before allowing anyone to come inside my house. \\n\\n\\nAfter hours upon hours of cleaning, things seemed to be in pretty good shape. I’d gotten the stains out of my flooring, for the most part. The new, reddish-brown hue of the couch had actually started to grow on me and there was not a single speck of blood left anywhere in this house. As my dad would say, “ya done good, kid!”\\n\\n\\nI heard my doorbell ring as I sank into my sofa. \\n\\n\\n“Hey, James!” The voice of my sister shouted through the door. “It’s Trina. Let me in!”\\n\\n\\nOh shit, oh shit, I thought, jumping to my feet. \\n\\n\\nShe’d told me a couple days ago that she was going to come by and I had completely forgot. \\n\\n\\n“One second!” I shouted as I ran into my bedroom. I quickly stripped off all of my blood soaked clothes and threw on fresh, clean garments. \\n\\n\\nI examined myself in the mirror, adjusting my hair and checking for any blood that might be caked on my skin. Nothing that I could see, though. \\n\\n\\nI ran out and opened the door. \\n\\n\\n“Hey sis,” I said, opening it just enough for her to see me. “Sorry. I completely forgot you were coming over.” \\n\\n\\n“That’s cool,” she said, digging through her purse. She pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it and began chewing. “You gonna invite me in, or what?” She laughed, pushing me aside and bursting through the door. \\n\\n\\nWhen she arrived in my living room, she stood there for a moment. I could tell by the way she stood, with her hands on her hips and her head kinked to the side, that she knew what had transpired here hours ago. \\n\\n\\nShe turned to me with a strange look about her and my stomach dropped. She looked back into the living room again and pointed with her thumb. \\n\\n\\n“New couch?” She asked.\\n\\n\\n“Huh, oh… yeah,” I started. I was caught off guard but relief washed over me, showering me with a feeling of ease. I came up with a quick lie. “Yeah, the damn cat scratched it up so bad. Tore a hole right in the back of it. Just picked that up yesterday.”\\n\\n\\nI walked over to the couch and plopped down, keeping a close eye on Trina as I did so. She paused for a moment, confusion painted on her face. Then, she began walking through the room, seemingly looking for something.\\n\\n\\nMy heart began to race as the panic, once again, set in. A bead of sweat formed on my brow that I quickly wiped away with the sleeve of my shirt. \\n\\n\\nShe made her way through the dining room, into the kitchen and back around into the living room. Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. \\n\\n\\n“You don’t have a cat…”\",\n",

Then she looked back at me with an expression of both concern and confusion before saying the last thing she would ever say. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have a cat…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Turns out her name was Chloe, and by her count she had been here for at least three weeks. She wouldn’t say much about what she had seen or how she got here though, and it seemed to bring up painful memories when I asked. \\n\\nChloe rolled up the garage door, and I slid under to check both sides of the street. Everything looked clear at the moment, so I motioned for her to follow. We crept out and started heading to the left, working in the same way I was before finding her. The fog hadn’t lessened, and it seemed darker than it was before. \\n\\n“So you said people can turn into these things?” I whispered to her as we walked, keeping an eye on any side alleyways and the windows above. \\n\\n“Haven’t seen it myself. Only heard second hand from others. They said after so long in here people just begin to... morph. Grow other limbs, twist in ways no human should, lots of fucked up stuff.”\\n\\nWe both shuddered thinking of it, how it could happen to us. We walked in silence for a while after that. Listening for any movement in the stillness of the fog. There was a scream some distance away, probably two blocks or so to our left. It was cut off quickly. \\n\\n“You think...” she started to ask. I just nodded in response. Someone just met their end.\\n\\nThere was movement ahead. Subtle, almost unnoticeable except for a small scraping sound it left behind it. There was something dragging itself across the pavement just a ways in front of us. Something big. The streetlights on either side began to flicker, causing my perception to falter. I couldn’t tell if the shadow of whatever it was was coming closer or moving away. The lights finally went out completely, leaving us in an ethereal darkness. \\n\\n“Fuck.” I heard Chloe whisper. I looked over and could make out her silhouette, holding the crowbar she had found, prepared to strike if need be. “Be ready to run.”\\n\\nI grunted acknowledgement. Whatever it was had stopped moving. The shadow was still ahead, almost like a statue now. Despite being able to make out Chloe’s silhouette, this just looked like a large blob. An inkblot on the foggy background, towering at least eight feet tall. \\n“Think we can sneak past?” I posed the question. \\n\\n“Probably not.” She replied. “Not that we have much choice.”\\n\\nWe moved to one side of the street, pressing ourselves against the brick wall of a storefront. Trying to move as quickly and silently as possible, we shimmied along the edge, making our way past the blob while not taking an eye off of it. We had made it a couple of feet past when I tripped on gutter coming off the building. \\n\\n*THUNK*\\n\\nI hit the ground hard, landing on my knee. Pain shot up my leg. I bit my lip to try and stifle any noise before it could come out. Blood began to bead around my teeth. \\n\\n“Run.” Chloe whispered.\\n\\nI looked back to see the blob unfurling through the gloom. Appendages rising out of it on every possible side and angle, all ending in hands with jagged, broken fingers. I still couldn’t see the whole thing clearly, just the shadow. It let out a high pitched screech, almost like a dog whistle before thundering towards us. \\n\\nAdrenaline shot through my veins. I went from the kneeling position on my hurt knee to a full on sprint, Chloe right beside me. Despite its size the blob was right behind, keeping on is at an ever-closing distance. \\n\\n“Next crossing, turn left.” Chloe said, breathless. “It shouldn’t be able to take sharp turns.”\\n\\nWhen we hit the next intersection we both took the left around the corner, staying to the wall as tight as we could. Chloe was right, it went cascading past, hitting a building on the opposite side of the street and busting through its window with a loud crash. Fuck. We were just trying to get some distance but we raised the dinner bell instead. The now-familiar screams of the damned rose all around us as they came charging from any hiding place possible. \\n\\n“Oh goddammit.” Chloe said. There was a group of creatures slithering toward us from an alleyway, snakelike bodies with human heads and faces. From ahead of us there was something lumbering in our direction, more than double my height, with arms and legs like small trees. This was bad. We were surrounded by ever more horrifying creatures. The fog was closing in along with these monsters. Chloe and I huddled together, backs to the wall, waiting for our inevitable death after death. \\n\\nOne of the snake creatures sprung forward. Chloe tried to swipe it away with her weapon but didn’t hit it in time. Her crowbar made a sickly crunch in the monster as it hit the side, but it had already sunk teeth into her leg. She cried out in pain as I reached down, attempting to pry it off. \\n\\n“Shit. I wanted to get out of here.” She said, “Didn’t want to give that bastard the satisfaction...”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off again as she looked down at the monster. I finally managed to pry its jaws open and pull it off of her leg, holding it right behind the head so it couldn’t bite me as well. As we were looking down at it I suddenly felt lightheaded, and got the feeling in my stomach like I was dropping through space. Chloe looked like she was having the same feeling, though that could have just been the pain from the bite. \\n\\nThe feeling finally faded. I grabbed the snake monster by the head and twisted it as far as I could. It let out a snap and a small squeal, life fading from its eyes. I threw it away into the street. \\n\\n“What the fuck?” I said, looking around me. The street and surrounding storefronts were gone. In their place we’re closely growing trees, almost cutting off the fog due to how thickly grouped they were. \\n\\n“I’ve never had the change happen while I’m in the open.” Chloe whispered through grit teeth. “It’s always while I’m holed up somewhere.”\\n\\n“So where do we go now?” I asked. I had only experienced the town. This was even more out of my wheelhouse than that was, and I was lost as is. \\n\\nShe simply looked around, then started limping towards the nearest thicket of trees. She stopped by one and looked up. The trees grew tall, fog obscuring everything past the first layer of branches that started about twenty feet up. She seemed to be sizing up the tree, inspecting it. \\n\\n“Think you can climb?” She asked.\\n\\n“Why? Not like the fog is any less up there. We’re still just as blind.” I told her. She grimaced at that. It would be great to get a vantage point to see our surroundings, but I doubt we would actually be able to see any more than we can now. If anything, it would just risk more injury. \\n\\nWe set off through the fog, knocking a mark into every other tree we passed with the crowbar so we could make sure we weren’t walking in circles. Eventually we came to a clearing with a small shack, the door closed and windows shuttered. We cautiously pushed the door open, checking inside. \\n\\nA knife flashed by my head, sticking halfway into the door behind me. I heard a voice from the corner. \\n\\n“Get out.” A low growl. Vaguely male. The voice sounded muffled though.  I squinted to see in the dim light. A man was standing in the corner, a hood drawn up over his head. He moved towards us, continuing to speak. “Not supposed to be here. Need to leave. Need to get out. Damned things. Not gonna be like them. Not gonna be damned.”\\n\\nAs he stepped forward I could see why he sounded this way. Chloe gasped behind me. His mouth was halfway sealed shut by his own flesh. His right arm seemed normal, but his left was grotesquely fused together, forming into a talon. \\n\\n[“He’s turning.” Chloe whispered. ](https://thehorrorstore.home.blog)',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Amy is a kitchen witch. At least, that’s what she likes to call herself. She observes the pagan holidays when she can and maintains a dainty altar, but it was in the kitchen that she found her power. Cooking mostly, some baking, a little cleaning. She always said there was magic in creativity, and creativity in cooking, that recipes were just instructions for rituals with tangible, edible, and satisfying results. So maybe they weren’t hexes or miracles or other things you’d call magic on the surface, but they didn’t have to be to connect her with her higher self.\\n\\nToday I found her in the kitchen as she applied herself to gently kneading a fresh batch of dough. The yeasty lump gave beneath her tiny hands, squishing, and stretching, and rolling as she leaned into it. This would become her second loaf of the day. The first baked away in the oven beside her, filling the apartment with the scent of sweet, hot bread.\\n\\n“Smells good. What’s this for again?” I said as I sauntered into the kitchen, wrapping my arms around her as I kissed her cheek.\\n\\n“Lughnasadh.”\\n\\n“Right. Luna saw. That’s when the moon cuts down all your enemies with a saw blade and turns them into scarecrows, right?”\\n\\n“I mean, pretty much. There’s something about bread, and harvest, and young bulls replacing old bulls, but your version is much better. You really know your holidays, babby.”\\n\\n“That’s why they pay me the big bucks.” I leaned back a bit, appreciating her and everything we had together. I loved our humor.\\n\\n“Do they? Why haven’t I seen these big bucks?” Amy grinned, separating the dough with a knife and roughing out the shape of a man.\\n\\n“Oh, because I keep them in an off-shore account. Can’t be too careful these days.”\\n\\n“You really can’t,” she said, turning slightly to face me, her tiny hand pressing against my stomach.\\n\\nA wave of heat washed over me, followed by dizzy nausea. My legs felt weak as I looked down in confusion and found not her hand, but the ornate hilt of a knife sticking out from my belly.\\n\\n“Wha—” I gasped as my legs gave out, blood quickly pooling around my knees.\\n\\n“Sacrifice,” Amy said, reaching toward me and coating her hands in my blood. She then stood and transferred the blood to the man-loaf waiting on the counter. “The old bull must make way for the new. But don’t worry, babby. I’m not replacing you.”\\n\\n“You—what?” My eyes had difficulty tracking her. My heart was racing, or trying to, but it only helped me bleed out faster. Fear sharpened the edges of my confusion. Was I *dying?*\\n\\n“I still love you.” She leaned down to cup my face, placing a gentle kiss on my lips. I kissed her back out of habit, but a chill of cold terror raced down my spine. How could she kiss me so sweetly after stabbing me in the stomach? “Just because the sacrifice is necessary doesn’t mean I want you to die. So, the young bull will be your vessel.”\\n\\nMy mouth worked to form words, but none came out as I slipped the rest of the way to the floor, resting on my side. Amy brought over a large crystal, placed it in my hands and let it lean against the wound. I could feel the weight of it, but nothing else. No pain. Just heat where the crystal touched me, and a creeping cold everywhere else.\\n\\nShe stroked my hair where I lay, humming something I couldn’t identify until the doorbell rang.\\n\\n“Ah, that will be the young bull from Tinder now,” she whispered, kissing my forehead and rising to answer the door. She wiped her bloody hands on the skull-printed fabric of her apron, careful to avoid the lace trim, and opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” Amy chirped as she opened the door.\\n\\n“Hi,” a man’s voice said with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement. He sounded young. Younger than me, anyway. “Are you Sarah?”\\n\\n*Sarah?*\\n\\n“That’s me,” she said brightly. “Come on in.” I couldn’t see much from my position on the floor. A bookshelf about four and a half feet tall separated the kitchen from the entryway. All I could see was the door opening a little wider to let the “young bull” in and a wisp of Amy’s hair moving back to accommodate. “How was the drive? Not too long, I hope?”\\n\\nI could see him then. He was tall, and fit without being overly ripped. His jaw was strong with a sharp angle some people called “rugged”, and his blue eyes sparkled with oblivious inexperience. He couldn’t have been more than twenty-five, a little more than half my age, and could easily have passed for younger. I wanted to shout for him to run—I tried—but I couldn’t find the air to even wheeze a warning.\\n\\n“Oh, uh.” He laughed awkwardly. How did someone who looked like him ever feel awkward? “No. I mean it was just an hour and half.” He turned back toward her before he’d entered far enough to really see the kitchen—to see me on the floor. “It was worth it for a chance to meet you.”\\n\\nI couldn’t roll my eyes, but the urge was there.\\n\\n“I’m Mike, by the way. I don’t know if you saw in my profile, or anything … ” He trailed off and had that “deer in the headlights” look everyone got when they first met Amy. The same look I’d probably had eight years ago when I’d first met her. She was beautiful, after all.\\n\\nShort, blonde and busty. That’s how her best friend would describe her in jest, but it was true. She stood only four-foot-eleven, and I didn’t know anyone shorter than her, which was just as well for me, since at five-six I wasn’t winning any height contests. Her hair was a kind of shadowy corn-silk blonde, even in the sun, with curls that wouldn’t quit. And she was definitely busty, with a tiny waist and full hips to balance her out.\\n\\nThat limited description didn’t do her justice, though. It left out how her pale eyes shifted with the sky, becoming blue, grey, or green depending on the light. It didn’t account for her laugh, or the way her smile captivated everyone who saw it. It couldn’t convey her brilliant mind, or loving spirit …\\n\\nHowever, it wasn’t her loving spirit that captivated people at first sight. It was definitely the “short, blonde and busty” business that did it, and it was working overtime on the guy standing just outside the kitchen.\\n\\nThe poor idiot.\\n\\n“Mike,” she said. “That’s my little brother’s name.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he blushed a violent red, scrubbing the back of his head in embarrassment. “Shit. I shouldn’t have said anything. Is that weird for you?”\\n\\n*I don’t know, Mike,* I wanted to say, fear of my own mortality making room for an angry spark of bitter jealousy. *Is it weird for you to try and bang my girlfriend while I’m dying in the kitchen?*\\n\\nA wave of vertigo washed over me, like the energy needed to fuel the jealousy was more than I could muster.\\n\\nMan, I was losing a lot of blood.\\n\\nAmy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” I could hear the smile in her voice.\\n\\nMike smiled back. It was a great smile. Even I had to admit that.\\n\\nPoor handsome idiot.\\n\\n“Can you wait here a second,” she asked. She waited for a nod from him before moving back to me. Fear came back cold and sluggish as she knelt at my side. Her fingers brushed my cheek, hot against my cooling skin. I tried to speak, tried to grab her hand to stop her, but she slipped away, picking up the crystal and offering me another quick kiss before returning to Mike’s side saying, “Here, hold this.”\\n\\nMike looked a little baffled, but appeared to be game, accepting the crystal with both hands. “You’re not what I expected,” he said, smiling in a way that suggested he wasn’t going to let a little weirdness cheat him out of a solid Tinder match.\\n\\n“That’s okay,” Amy said, pulling a small compact out of her apron pocket and withdrawing a small pinch of the dark powder residing within.\\n\\n“Hey, is … is this blood?”\\n\\n“It sure is,” she said, blowing the powder in his face.\\n\\nMike’s eyes rolled upward, disappearing as his head tilted back and his jaw went slack. Amy leaned around him, checking to ensure the powder had done its job. Apart from his jaw and lolling head, though, he was stiff as stone.\\n\\nShe withdrew a knife from the apron’s pocket—one that looked eerily similar to the one sticking out of me—and made a small cut on the outside of his arm. Nothing that would need stitches, the lucky bastard. Then she gathered it on a clean cotton handkerchief and returned to the kitchen just in time to remove the first loaf of bread from the oven.\\n\\nShe inhaled deeply as she lifted the tray and set it on top of the stove to cool. I felt the heat of the oven wash over me and realized just how cold I was. How cold I had been steadily growing. How little energy I had left in me to care about it all. In that heat, I realized the woman I loved had killed me and was baking bread over my almost-corpse, and all I could really think about was how much I wanted just one more kiss before I was gone.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t even ask for that much as into the oven the loaf of man-bread wearing my blood went. Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.\\n\\nFor the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.\\n\\nWhen the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me *she* would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.\\n\\nMaybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.\\n\\nWhen she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.\\n\\nShe took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.\\n\\nThe crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.\\n\\nTaking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.\\n\\nI just didn’t want to leave her.\\n\\nWith the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.\\n\\nShit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?\\n\\nI moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.\\n\\nNo, that wasn’t right. \\n\\nI stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.\\n\\nWhy was the shower weird?\\n\\nRealization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.\\n\\nThe faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?\\n\\nI climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.\\n\\nDetails filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.\\n\\nMy stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.\\n\\nAmy had stabbed me.\\n\\nActually stabbed me.\\n\\nTo death. What the hell?\\n\\nI stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.\\n\\n“You stabbed me!”\\n\\nAmy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”\\n\\n“You *stabbed* me.”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“Why the hell did you stab me!”\\n\\n“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”\\n\\n“But you *stabbed* me!”\\n\\n“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”\\n\\nI still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … \\n\\n“I’m taller.”\\n\\nShe beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.\\n\\n“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”\\n\\nI lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”\\n\\n“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”\\n\\nI sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”\\n\\nI was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.\\n\\n“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”\\n\\nAnd I’ll be damned if [she didn’t have a point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy)',\n",

Then she reset the timer and carefully dabbed Mike’s blood onto the fresh loaf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next forty minutes, Amy cleaned up the kitchen, careful not to disturb the ever-growing pool of blood spreading from beneath me, then curled up on the couch with her orange tabby familiar, Finn, to add a few new rows to the temperature blanket she’d been crocheting. I continued to quietly bleed out on the kitchen floor and poor Mike drooled in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the oven timer sounded, she was reluctant to rise. She had been made cat-atonic with Finn curled up on her lap, and while usually this would result in an amusing back-and-forth where she would inform me &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; would rather die than move him, today it seemed her bread was more important. She extracted herself from kitty loves, and freed the bread from the oven. While it cooled, she prepped Mike’s body, cleaning away the drool and drawing strange runes down his arms and across his face in what looked like ash.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was black eyeshadow. I don’t know what works for her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she’d finished, the bread was cool enough to cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took a portion of each loaf, careful to ensure each piece bore a trace of blood, and made her way back over to Mike to place one in his mouth. She delicately pressed the blood-baked side against his tongue before closing his jaw around it and muttered something I couldn’t really hear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal in Mike’s hands briefly blazed with a strange red light, then it dimmed to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Taking the crystal from him, she moved back to me and put it in my hands, such as she could. I didn’t have any strength left. I barely had the strength to hold on to consciousness, let alone a heavy-ass crystal. I should have been long dead already, I thought. It felt like I’d been bleeding for an eternity, yet somehow I was grateful for the trace of life I’d managed to hold onto. Not because I was terrified to die, though that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t want to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the crystal in place, she gently opened my mouth and put the bread on my tongue, again muttering words I didn’t know, or was too far gone to recognize, and the crystal burned against me. Red light filled the room. Then everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood in the shower, cold water pelting my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shit, that was cold. Why was I taking an ice shower?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to turn it off, bending much further than felt normal to angrily grab the faucet and twist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, that wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up straight as the water slowed to a drip, staring down at the hardware like it was a puzzle I was just too slow to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was the shower weird?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Realization spread like dawn’s heat across my scalp, but didn’t bring much understanding with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The faucet was too low. The shower head came to my chin instead of my forehead. And—wait, wasn’t I dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the shower, fumbling with legs that were somehow too long, and a center of gravity I’d never experienced. I wrapped a towel around hips I didn’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Details filtered back in quickly then, flashing through my mind in bright fits and bursts, jagged and full of bile. No, I was full of bile. But not for long. I bent over the toilet, which felt several feet further away than it had this morning, and emptied my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach, which did not have any stab wounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy had stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Actually stabbed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To death. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the bathroom and found her hovering over the mess in the kitchen—the mess that was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You stabbed me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy grinned as she turned to face me. “Hi, babby!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I did.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you stab me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Because the athame is an essential part of the recipe. It just doesn’t work without the stabbing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But you &lt;em&gt;stabbed&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And you’re fine now! Look at your new body! Isn’t it great?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still seethed, but took a moment to look over the body. It was very fit. Well toned—cared for. Slightly tan in a way that suggested time spent outside, but not for appearances. The hands were soft without being unused, which suggested Mike had worked with them, but also taken care of them afterward. I felt the power in the thighs—now my thighs. I felt the strength in my arms. No aches and pains, no overt signs of disease, and best of all … &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m taller.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She beamed at me. I hated that she could smile like that and make me want to forgive her anything, but I knew I also loved her too much to hold it against her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought you’d appreciate that,” she said. “Wanna help me bury your body?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted what had to be a beautifully sculpted eyebrow—I hadn’t really stopped to analyze it on my way out of the bathroom, so it was just a guess on my part—and stared her down. “That’s not a real question.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nope! I bought new shovels. A new shovel. There’s one shovel. I’ll drive!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed again. She’d always had a way with me, and in that moment I knew she always would. “Alright. Fine. Just lemme get his pants on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to need a whole new wardrobe. Great.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amy said, dancing over to my side to trail her fairy fingers over my exposed chest. “I think we need to give this bad boy a test run, don’t you? After all, it’s what he signed up for.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be damned if &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeathByProxy\"&gt;she didn’t have a point.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '*In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.*\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/)\\n\\nIt was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.\\n\\n“I saw her again, Mike. I saw *her*.”\\n\\n“Who babe? Who did you see?”\\n\\n“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”\\n\\n“Are you...are you sure it was her?”\\n\\n“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”\\n\\n“Umm, were you able to honk?”\\n\\n“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was *broken*. It didn’t make a sound.”\\n\\nDespite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.\\n\\n“Julia, what are you worried about?\"\\n\\n\"That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.\"\\n\\n\"Aww babe, you don\\'t think that was actually real do you?\" My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I\\'ve seen it twice now and we couldn\\'t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I\\'m still freaking out.\"\\n\\n\"Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, *I\\'m* the one that should be worrying.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I want you.\"\\n\\nI was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.\\n\\nWe laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.\\n\\n\"That was great,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you go again?\"\\n\\n\"*Now*?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n\"But I just...I mean.\" I didn\\'t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.\\n\\n\"How about if I…you know,\" she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.\\n\\nThat did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.\\n\\nAfter the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn\\'t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with *this*. This was insanity. She still wanted more.\\n\\nI was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.\\n\\n*She\\'s in the bathroom,* I thought.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn\\'t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?\\n\\nI called her name and didn\\'t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Couldn\\'t sleep. Went down to Rusty\\'s. Didn\\'t want to wake you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\-Love, Julia\"\\n\\nRusty\\'s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia\\'s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.\\n\\nI headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn\\'t like Julia and it wasn\\'t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.\\n\\n\"Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.\"\\n\\nHe gave me an incredulous look. \"Maybe. Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Look, here\\'s her picture.\" I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.\\n\\nHe looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.\\n\\n“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say *I’d* want to know. Your girlfriend *was* here and—”\\n\\n“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.\\n\\n“Excuse me?”\\n\\n“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”\\n\\n“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don\\'t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”\\n\\nMy stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.\\n\\nNow I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never *walked* in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.\\n\\nI’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.\\n\\nThere were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.\\n\\nThe floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.\\n\\nLike any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.\\n\\nThe people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.\\n\\nI replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises *she* made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.\\n\\nThat my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”\\n\\nBut she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.\\n\\nYeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.\\n\\n“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.\\n\\nShe looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.\\n\\nI turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.\\n\\nBehind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.\\n\\nI continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.\\n\\nAfter a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.\\n\\nThis wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other *thing* almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, \"Julia I think you should get some help\", and blocked her number.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nLater, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.\\n\\n“Man, that was so messed up what she did. *Fucked* up. You deserve better.”\\n\\n“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”\\n\\n“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”\\n\\n“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”\\n\\n“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”\\n\\n“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”\\n\\n“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”\\n\\nI had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.\\n\\nBut what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.\\n\\nJulia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nI knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.\\n\\n“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”\\n\\n“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”\\n\\nHe gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.\\n\\n“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”\\n\\nHe led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.\\n\\nI hoped for the best, but feared the worst.\\n\\n“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. *Sick*.”\\n\\n“I had heard she went in-patient.”\\n\\nHe nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t *blame* her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.\\n\\nI was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”\\n\\n“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you *if* you came by.”\\n\\nHe stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”\\n\\nI opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but *you* can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Love Always,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Julia\\n\\nThe weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.\\n\\nI had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.\\n\\nI couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.\\n\\n*What if it’s not her?*\\n\\n*What if she ignores me?*\\n\\n*What if she screams and runs?*\\n\\nBut the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\nIn a featureless motel room we lay.\\n\\nShe was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.\\n\\nIn the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.\\n\\nShe looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. *We* were back. That was all I needed.\\n\\n“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\nShe rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?\\n\\n“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.\\n\\nIn her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.\\n\\n“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.\\n\\n“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”\\n\\n“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”\\n\\n“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”\\n\\nShe nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Babe, what did you take?”\\n\\n“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”\\n\\n“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.\" I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \"I’m calling 911.”\\n\\nShe grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”\\n\\n“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?\"\\n\\n“Michael. You’re here to make *sure* I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n“So that’s what’s been going on,” *Michael told me*. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”\\n\\n*“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.*\\n\\n“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”\\n\\n*“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”*\\n\\n“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—*had* a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”\\n\\n*“Michael,” I said urgently.* “*Do not.”*\\n\\n“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”\\n\\n*I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.*\\n\\n“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”\\n\\n*“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”*\\n\\n“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”\\n\\n*“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”*\\n\\n\\\\###\\n\\n*I didn\\'t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn\\'t need to know what he did or rather* didn\\'t *do, because I\\'m the one that suggested it to him.*\\n\\n*I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.*\\n\\n*They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.*\\n\\n*What if there could be some sort of compromise?*\\n\\n*I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that\\'s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.*\\n\\n*I saw it in the headlines a few days later,* **Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.** *Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.*\\n\\n*I\\'ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?*\\n\\n*“Sure,” they said.*\\n\\n*\"Infinitesimal, but yeah,\" they said.*\\n\\n*Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?*\\n\\n*\"Are you serious right now?\" they asked.*\\n\\n*If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?*\\n\\n*“No,” they said.*\\n\\n*“Impossible,” they said.*\\n\\n[\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\[ll\\\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/)',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which Michael continues to tell me his story over the phone from an anonymous motel location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fglt67/honk_if_youre_horny/\"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was months later when I got the call. Julia called me from her cell phone in a complete panic. I could hear the cracks in her voice and knew she was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I saw her again, Mike. I saw &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who babe? Who did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The scary nun lady from Seattle. I was riding with Stacy and first, I saw the bumper sticker and I remembered that weird radio program we heard and then she passed the car and it was her, oh God it was her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you...are you sure it was her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Positive. She wasn’t driving a van though. It was just a black car. Stacy didn’t see her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Umm, were you able to honk?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried. I was in the passenger seat and when I saw that bumper sticker I leaped over the console while Stacy was driving and tried to honk the horn and she got all pissed. But the horn on her car, Mike, it was &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;. It didn’t make a sound.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all rational thoughts and no belief in the supernatural, my mouth went dry. This phone call and what Julia was telling me was unnerving. Her panic was rubbing off on me and I could feel my stomach drop as if I was on a thrill ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, what are you worried about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That guy on the radio, he said we had to honk or something bad would happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww babe, you don&amp;#39;t think that was actually real do you?&amp;quot; My skeptical self was doing the talking, trying to convince both Julia and me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve seen it twice now and we couldn&amp;#39;t turn off the broadcast when it came on. Could you come over? I&amp;#39;m still freaking out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, ok. What did he say again? Something about blue balls? If anything, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the one that should be worrying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to her apartment and barely made it two steps before something pounced on me and almost knocked me over. It was Julia and her smooth thighs wrapped tight around me and she was completely naked. She leaned into my neck and kissed me and her hair and skin was damp and she kissed my neck with a strong thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you. I just got out of the shower,&amp;quot; she whispered into my ear. &amp;quot;I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still carrying her in the hall and I managed to walk awkwardly towards the couch with her legs wrapped around my hips and I ripped my clothes off right there. She was really wet and she had never come onto me this aggressively before and it was a huge turn on. We started for a while on the couch and then finished in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We laid together in a naked and sweaty heap, her head on my chest rising up and down with my labored breath.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was great,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you go again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, why not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I just...I mean.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t want to let her down. I needed a little more time to recharge, maybe a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How about if I…you know,&amp;quot; she said and had a mischievous look in her eye and went down towards my lower half and took me in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That did it for me. I was suddenly able to go again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the third time (with an oral session on her after the second while I recovered) I collapsed beside her, my hand tracing her inner thigh as she guided my fingers inside.I wasn&amp;#39;t a teenager anymore, and even if I was there was no way I could keep up with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. This was insanity. She still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was breathing heavy not from passion, but from exhaustion. I could barely keep my eyes open and I soon fell asleep by her side as she writhed and grinded against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke disoriented to a dark and empty room. I could no longer feel Julia by my side. I was still groggy and half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s in the bathroom,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But after ten minutes I was fully awake and she hadn&amp;#39;t returned. I got up and turned on the lights. It was just after midnight. Where was she?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called her name and didn&amp;#39;t get a response. I texted her only to hear her cellphone buzz on the night stand. I got dressed and went out to the living room and kitchenette. On the counter was a note.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. Went down to Rusty&amp;#39;s. Didn&amp;#39;t want to wake you.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Love, Julia&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rusty&amp;#39;s Lounge was a chill little dive bar a few blocks from Julia&amp;#39;s place. We liked to walk down there from time to time and have a drink. We enjoyed the vibe and liked people watching together. What was she doing down there? This was so unlike her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed that way on foot  As I entered the place, it seemed dead. There was no one inside except for the bartender. I began to get worried. This wasn&amp;#39;t like Julia and it wasn&amp;#39;t safe for her to walk down here alone at night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, did you see a brunette girl come in here? Early twenties. Really pretty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me an incredulous look. &amp;quot;Maybe. Who wants to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do. Look, here&amp;#39;s her picture.&amp;quot; I pulled out my phone and showed him some selfies we had taken on our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked down at the pictures and I saw the edges of a smile creep up on his face but this soon turned into a grimace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, this is gonna hurt. I’m going to level with you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’ve been in your position before and I always say &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; want to know. Your girlfriend &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; here and—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fiancée,” I said, cutting him off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re engaged. She’s my fiancée.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus. This is gonna be worse than I thought.” He shook his head and looked down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just check the men’s bathroom. And hey, you don&amp;#39;t have a weapon on you or anything, do ya?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach turned. I shook my head no and approached the restroom door with dread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had been cheated on before in a prior relationship. I never &lt;em&gt;walked&lt;/em&gt; in on anything, but I had caught my previous live-in girlfriend texting another guy, talking about meeting up again, etc. I’ll never forget that feeling of betrayal I experienced when I first stumbled upon the texts, how it was such a raw and physiological feeling, deep down in my guts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget because it was nothing but a precursor to what I experienced when I stepped into that restroom at our local dive bar. What I found on this particular night was exponentially worse than the pain of the previous infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were two men. One sat on the ledge of the porcelain sink with his bare ass, socks still on and jeans crumpled up on the floor next to his boots. His eyes were closed and he stared to the ceiling in pleasure. The other man stood with his pants around his ankles, his shirt pulled up over his protruding hairy stomach, and he was thrusting and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was dirty yellowed tile and there were pieces of soggy toilet paper and cigarette butts dissolving in a puddle of water, crumpled up brown paper towels spilling out of a trash can. What I hoped was dirt and mud was smeared elsewhere on the tile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like any red-blooded male in this day and age, I had gone on PornHub at various dry spells throughout my life and watched some pretty raunchy stuff: girl on girl, threesomes, double penetrations, and tag teams and the like. It was nothing I desired to experience with Julia or anyone else for that matter. It was just something to get off to, the subject matter I would feel ashamed of for watching as soon as I was finished.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The people in the videos didn’t even seem real as I watched, they were actors playing out a scene. They were just fantasies and projections—means to an end—and to see Julia, the love of my life in a scene straight from one of these pornos was extremely traumatic and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replayed it in my mind over and over again for the months that would come. I had nightmares over it; Julia bent over at the waist between the two men, the wet sounds and sucking and slapping and slurping, the men groaning, the noises &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; made, the juxtaposition of her bare feet on the filthy and disgusting floor, her bra and panties hanging over the graffitied stall divider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That my darling fiancée could be subjected to such depravity and objectification in such a grimy location before my very eyes was what would haunt me most of all down the road. It was the fact that she was just a piece of meat to them, a funny story they would tell their friends for years to come, “hey remember that one smoking hot chick we fucked in the bathroom of Rusty’s together? What a slut.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she was anything but a slut. She was mine and I was hers and she liked drawing and planting succulents and stealing the covers at night and singing in the shower and she was doing really well in her second year of pharmacy school and she wanted to own a house with a yard one day so we could get a dog together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that was the pain that came later, but for now what my mind was focused on was the complete and utter betrayal that was happening right before me, the sledgehammer of hurt that had slammed directly into my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia! How could you?” I yelled, my voice coming out all shaky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up from what she was doing in surprise, her eyes confused for a moment before registering that I was there. “Michael…” she started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and slammed through the restroom door and I felt the vomit come up quickly and spurt past my fingers and I staggered forward and kept walking and let it come out right there in the middle of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, a cacophony followed: her calling my name, the laughter of the men echoing off the tiled walls of the restroom, the bartender hollering at me for puking all through his bar and at the naked woman following me. I staggered out into the street and back to Julia’s apartment where I had parked my car. I left and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fell into a depression and heartache, the likes of which I’d never thought possible. It continued on through the next two or three weeks. I was on the verge of losing my job, but thanks to my parents and friends who got me some help, I was able to see a psychiatrist and take medical leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to receive texts from Julia, daily and constantly after the episode at Rusty’s Lounge. There were apologies and desperate affirmations of her love, how she had made a big mistake, missed calls. I couldn’t bring myself to respond, the hurt was still too deep. I didn’t feel anger towards her, but rather a deep sense of loss and sadness. It was like a grieving and these texts from her might as well have been from a ghost, telling me of a future I would no longer get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month or so, I began to receive texts from her that disturbed me. She began to send nudes accompanied by texts of her begging me to come over, things she wanted me to do to her and how she should be punished. She sent videos that I would not watch and the nudes became more and more hardcore and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her. She wasn’t a prude or anything, but she had never sent anything that extreme before. This was some other person, some other &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; almost. It was like she had been possessed. I was disturbed to say the least. It really shook me up and sent me into a relapse of depression and anxiety and I sent her one last text, &amp;quot;Julia I think you should get some help&amp;quot;, and blocked her number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I would hear from mutual friends about how she was doing and what she was up to, rumors they had heard. It was as if they wanted me to relish in how far she had fallen after cheating on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Man, that was so messed up what she did. &lt;em&gt;Fucked&lt;/em&gt; up. You deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jamie said she saw her at this club the other night, just totally grinding up on these guys. Was hiking her skirt up and showing her ass and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was at this party after finals. Fucked this random dude she just met there in the bathroom. Then went home with another. Gross.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...making out with these two girls at Rossi’s…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She looks really bad lately. Keeps gettin up in the middle of class to go to the restroom. Bulimic?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“...failed all her finals. She hasn’t been in class much. She may drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Her parents have been really worried about her. I heard she got admitted to Lakeshore for a bit. I haven’t heard from them lately.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had often seen friends express a certain sort of schadenfreude over the downfall of exes who had supposedly wronged them. Whether it was an ex-girlfriend that had gotten fat or a former boyfriend that had ended up dating a stripper or an ex who was now pregnant and living in a trailer park somewhere, they seemed to enjoy the supposed bad luck that these former lovers experienced. They viewed it as if the universe had paid their ex back for wronging them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what was the alternative? To me, the more heinous crime would be to stay longer with a person that you were incompatible with, to continue to waste their time. Sure the break up would hurt, but that person was ultimately doing you a favor no matter how messily it ended. They were giving you the chance to meet the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia was my right person. I took no joy in hearing about these bad places that she had ended up. It only made me sad and filled me with a deep yearning for her, a strong urge to swoop in and rescue her from her shitty situation. Something was wrong with her and I slowly began to realize that maybe it had something to do with the broadcast. It was time to put my hurt aside and try to help her. I sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door with trepidation. Julia’s dad, Ron, answered the door, a slightly confused look on his face until he recognized me. He gave me a warm smile, but his eyes were tired.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Michael. Good to see you. It’s been a while. What can I do for you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s about Julia. I was wondering if you might know how I could get in touch with her. Her phone number seems to have been disconnected.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gave a furtive glance back inside his house and slid out past the screen door and onto the porch, shutting the front door gently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s sit out here and talk, Michael. Maurine hasn’t been doing so well since...um...everything that’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me over to a couple of wicker chairs on their front porch and we sat and stared out across the yard and the street. The winter was fading but hanging on for dear life. The sky still gray and the trees still naked. Daffodils had started to sprout and green shoots of grass stood upward through patches of yellow. A cold wind blew Ron’s sparse thinning gray hair around messily while I waited for him to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where she is, Mike. We were always so shocked and disappointed how things ended between you two, how she did you like that. You’re a good guy and I know you were good for her. You being here further proves that. We were excited that you two were engaged and were looking forward to you being a part of the family. It’s just, something got into her. She’s very sick, Mike. &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I had heard she went in-patient.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, we thought that we were making some headway, but she came out all zombified and slept all the time. She stopped taking her medicines. I mean, I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; her, with how they made her feel. I was just hoping we’d find a nice in-between, y’know? The psychiatrists couldn’t get it right. They said it was bipolar disorder and that she was in a constant, manic hypersexualized state. All they could do was kill her entire spirit with those drugs, beat her into submission. I just wish I had my daughter back.” He bit down on his lower lip and his mouth quivered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was on the verge of tears myself. “When’s the last you heard from her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Once she went off the meds, she went on some sort of tear. Ran away so to speak. We hear from her now and then when she needs money for a procedure or something. We actually paid for her to have a tubal and she went through with that, thank God. Last we heard from her was about two weeks ago. She never calls, just shows up, so I don’t have a number or anything to give you. She actually dropped something off for you. Told me to only give it to you &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you came by.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up and snuck back in his house and returned with a letter. “I would’ve called you to pick it up, but she said if you never came by it didn’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter in my car. I could see her familiar handwriting in pencil and soon I had speckled the note with several of my tears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, if you are reading this, then it means that curiosity has gotten the best of you and you’ve come by my parents looking for me. It can’t be that you’ve forgiven me and actually still care about me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No, it has to be pure curiosity that has led you here. How could you forgive me?  I can’t even forgive myself for what I’ve done to you and how I’ve hurt you. I never wanted something like that to happen. I’ve changed Michael and I can’t change back to how I was. Lord knows that I’ve tried.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I know you like I thought I knew you, I know that you will have started bargaining, thinking of ways that we could be together, coming up with ways to forgive me. That’s why I’ve written this letter, to tell you to stop. Do not look for me.I will only do it again and again and again. I don’t want you to hurt anymore. You deserve better.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember me how I was on that epic summer we shared. That’s how I like to remember myself and I am glad to have been able to share it with someone so special. I’ll never get that again, but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can. Just with someone that isn’t me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love Always,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks passed and turned into months. Life went on and I was numb. I didn’t enjoy things the way I used to and I was simply going through the motions. The joy was sucked from everything into a gray blandness. Food was sustenance. Sleep was a respite that occurred at my home which was only a shelter. Work was what allowed me to purchase the food and pay for the shelter. Everything was clinical and pragmatic and I only wished to fast forward past these doldrums. That was the way my life was going until I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had taken to driving around the greater parts of the city on my days off, hours spent in my car. A lot of this was to kill the time, but I think that deep down I knew that I was hoping I would see her. There right there—on this otherwise unremarkable day—I caught the flash of a familiar face as I drove past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be certain. Her hair was dyed pink and she was dressed in a style that I had never seen her in; fishnets with ripped jeans and a black crop top. She was smoking a cigarette and standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to a truck stop, looking out at the traffic. I pulled into the truck stop and sprinted towards her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if it’s not her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she ignores me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if she screams and runs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the glimmer of recognition flashed across her face as I came towards her and she smiled and ran towards me and we embraced each other in a tight squeeze. Despite the letter, despite what had happened and what we had told ourselves, we had finally found each other and would never let go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a featureless motel room we lay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was uncomfortable and squirming on the drive over, gripping my hand and taking deep breaths, almost writhing in the passenger seat next to me. We stopped at the closest motel we could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the room, I got her to calm down. There was no rushing, no need for blind hot passion and lust. We undressed slowly and kissed softly and took our time. It had been so long.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked different, smelled different, and tasted different. Her pink hair felt dry and flat and there was the sour taste of cigarettes on her kiss. There were sores on her neck and arms and her skin had a dusky appearance and felt a little rough. It didn’t matter. When I looked into her eyes, she was back. I was back. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; were back. That was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I never got rid of it,” she said. “Even when things were at their lowest and I needed the money, I still kept it. It was the only thing anchoring me to my past life.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She rolled over and reached across the bed to her messenger bag, which lay on the floor. As she dug around inside, I could glimpse a pack of cigarettes and lots of the shiny cellophane wrappers of condoms. Prescription pill bottles. A vibrator. Was that a syringe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This,” she said as she rolled back onto the bed and against me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In her hand she held her engagement ring. She slid it onto her ring finger. My heart filled. She was about to break it again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to do something for me,” she said as she came back from the bathroom. She had brought her bag in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do anything. I’m not going to lose you again. I know it wasn’t you behind all that stuff. I know it was the broadcast, the goddamn rule. Some sort of curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you understand it’s a curse, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course. I know no one would believe us. I know they’ll hang it on mental illness or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded. Her face was serious. “Then you’ll understand what I want you to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat. I noticed her speech was a little slurred. I looked closer into her eyes, her pupils. They were little black pinpoints. She lied back and took a deep breath, closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Babe, what did you take?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, I’m tired, so very tired. I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t keep living this way, fucking all the time, fucking whoever. The urge never stops.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Julia, we can make it work. We could have an open relationship. Toys. I can take care of you babe, please.&amp;quot; I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. &amp;quot;I’m calling 911.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed my wrists. “No Mike, this curse is bigger than anything this world has to offer. There is no cure, there is only escape. You know that. You call an ambulance, then it’s only gonna delay the inevitable. They’ll lock me up for a while and put me on psych meds and then kick me back out on the street and the cyle repeats itself. I’ve seen that movie  before.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But what do you want me to do? Make sure you don’t stop breathing? Are you just trying to rest?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael. You’re here to make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; I stop breathing. I took an entire bottle of 80 mg oxycontins. That oughta do…...it,” she said. “I wrote a note. It’s in the bathroom. You...can tell them you were asleep and woke up to me this...way”.Each word was coming out slower.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes again. “I...love….you. I’m...so glad you found me for this...one last...time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So that’s what’s been going on,” &lt;em&gt;Michael told me&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve been pacing around this motel room, watching Julia. She looks so peaceful. Her breathing is really shallow now. Oh I wrestled with calling 911, don’t think I didn’t. But when I looked through her bag and saw the life she had been living, I just couldn’t. I don’t know if she’s making the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Goddam, Michael. I’m so sorry,” I said. What do you say in a situation like this? I pondered on taking the initiative and calling the Chicago PD. There was no way that they could track him down in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. I found your website as I was sitting here and Googling “The Rules of the Road. You don’t know of any way to fix this, huh? Have you tracked this Buck Hensley fella down?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, no. I haven’t had the resources to. I don’t think his broadcast is coming from a terrestrial plane. My own theory is that it is all some sort of force of nature, striking whoever and whenever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, well. I guess these things happen. I’m gonna be logging off here soon. My dad has a 9 mm Beretta that he keeps in his garage—let me rephrase that—&lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a 9 mm Beretta. I’ve requisitioned it recently. I keep it in my glove compartment when I’m going through the rougher areas of Chicago, especially since I’ve spent my days off driving around.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael,” I said urgently.&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Do not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s sitting in my lap right now. I’m not going to lose her again. As soon as she goes, I go. Don’t try and stop me. You can call the cops after the call dies and I’m sure they’ll find us eventually. I guess the neighbors will hear the gunshot.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could only say his name again and again as he rambled on. I was really going to hear this man kill himself over the phone, wasn’t I? There was nothing I could do to stop it. I figured I had about a minute. His voice was growing more determined. I suddenly had a plan. It might be a long shot. I told it to him. He seemed skeptical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Seems risky. I don’t know what could happen. Do you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. You know what I want you to do is to just call 911 and get Julia some help and you too, but this might be the next best thing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you try and fuck with me on this, you’re still prolonging the inevitable. I’m hanging on by a very thin thread here. Don’t make this worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is my only idea, and frankly I think it kinda sucks. If you don’t wanna try it, please don’t try it. But you are right. I can’t do anything right now. I’m powerless. It’s your decision.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t need to hear how he called the ambulance, how they administered the naloxone just in time and were able to reverse the effects of the opioids and how Julia ended up in intensive care with her stomach pumped and on a respirator. Nor did I need to hear how Michael left her there that first day and drove and drove and drove. Driving miles and miles until he saw it. And when he did see it, that car with the familiar bumper sticker on it, I didn&amp;#39;t need to know what he did or rather&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;do, because I&amp;#39;m the one that suggested it to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did want to know what it was like when she was discharged and he was there to pick her up, the look in her eyes, the tears that both of them cried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They say that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. What if loving and losing and getting it back again only to lose it twice in one lifetime was too much for one soul to bear? Michael could survive such a thing, but the rest of his life would alway be changed, a walking numbness that he wouldn’t be present for, his mind forever on thoughts of her and what he had lost. Or he could get past this, turn over a new leaf and start a new life and be somewhat happy. But the thoughts of forgetting her and moving on were too much for him to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there could be some sort of compromise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew there would be no happy ending; that’s not the way the rules worked, but what if there was the next best thing? In the end, that&amp;#39;s what Michael and Julia were left with. There was no real other option for the two of them. Neither could live without the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw it in the headlines a few days later,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Couple Perishes in Fire at Bed and Breakfast Cabin, Cause Unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accompanying the article was a photo of both Michael and Julia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked several scientists, physicists who were renowned in their field the same question: Could the friction of two bodies moving together create an element of heat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sure,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Infinitesimal, but yeah,&amp;quot; they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could that heat generated somehow be great enough to result in some type of spontaneous combustion, a sort of human friction that could start a fire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Are you serious right now?&amp;quot; they asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the two bodies were rubbing hard enough, fast enough? If the passion between the two was hot enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Impossible,” they said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/jonesingforfear/\"&gt;~~~[ll]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I haven\\'t tried it yet.\\n\\nThe casket is upstairs. I haven\\'t seen it since we visited the funeral home. I\\'m surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar strangers. They all wear black, like me. I can hear their muttered, solemn conversations.\\n\\n\"-awful thing to happen-\"\\n\\n\"She was so young, it didn\\'t look like anything was wrong-\"\\n\\n\"-I hope the family will be okay-\"\\n\\n\"-No, I don\\'t know why she did it-\"\\n\\n\"Is that the boy who found her?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, he\\'s been sitting there since they came back.\"\\n\\n\"Poor lad. Poor, poor lad. No one should have to go through this.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know the people who are talking about me. I just know they are friends of granny and granda. Like everyone else in this village, I don\\'t know them, but they know me.\\n\\nDid they know her?\\n\\nI look at the still cup of red wine in my hand. I bring it to my lips and drink. It tastes better than I thought it would, offering a small comfort. I sigh when I empty the glass, then set it down on the coffee table.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I just did that. Maybe I\\'ll do it again.\\n\\nMy mother is somewhere in the house, crying her eyes out. Dad is in the kitchen. I don\\'t know why he isn\\'t with mom right now. I\\'m still thirsty. I need another drink of wine.\\n\\nI stand up, leaving the wine glass behind. Strangers politely shuffle aside, letting me pass. They all offer their condolences and say that they are here if I need anything. I don\\'t know why they\\'re here in the first place. I don\\'t know any of them, and none of them knew my sister.\\n\\nPictures are framed on the walls. I look up at one and stop.\\n\\nA boy and a girl are smiling back at me, wrapped in towels in the back seat of a car. They both still have chubby faces and eyes which haven\\'t seen how cruel the world is yet. I keep walking.\\n\\nDad\\'s hunched over the sink. He\\'s not moving. A wine bottle and cork are beside him, the latter laying on its side. His hand is on the wine bottle, tenderly stroking its lip. There are more strangers in here, who give me sad smiles and try to pat my back. I lean away from them.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bottle of red wine. I pick it up. There\\'s a paper cup next to it. I pour the wine into it, to the top. It overflows so I stop and set the bottle down. I drink the entire cup in one gulp until my stomach cannot take anymore. The paper cup crumples in my hand before I throw it into the bin. I leave the kitchen. I go upstairs.\\n\\nThe first room I see is open. There\\'re people sitting in chairs, looking at something blocked by a wall. I can see the edge of it. It\\'s wood. Inside is something I couldn\\'t get down from the shower in time. Granny\\'s in there, and she\\'s leading the rosary. The people she\\'s praying with have never met my family. They\\'re dressed in nice suits and have little books. They gave me one. I haven\\'t opened it yet. They\\'re all staying in granny\\'s hotel. I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever been to this village before.\\n\\nOne of the people turns to me, frowning. He\\'s a black man. There\\'s no one of his skin color in this village, but there\\'s plenty in the city my sister and I grew up in, across the ocean. She\\'d want to be buried over there, not here.\\n\\nThe man stands up and walks to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders and leads me into the room. My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she\\'s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She\\'s dressed in a beautiful white dress.\\n\\n\"Boy,\" the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister\\'s, \"this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.\"\\n\\nI glance at her. She\\'s still praying. Her eyes haven\\'t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.\\n\\nThe black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn\\'t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.\\n\\nI can still feel it.\\n\\nI look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. \"Caoimhe,\" he said, turning to my grandmother, \"Caoimhe, your grandson is here.\" I\\'m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.\\n\\nGranny\\'s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. \"Oh, Ned,\" she says, \"Ned, please come and sit beside me.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can\\'t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.\\n\\n\"Ned,\" she says, \"I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it\\'s like to lose someone you\\'ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...\" She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.\\n\\nI take my chance and sit up, but I don\\'t leave. I walk up to the open casket.\\n\\nMy sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody\\'s paying any attention to me.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say in a whisper, \"Jenny, can... can you hear me?\"\\n\\nShe keeps her lips pressed together.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I say again, still whispering, \"Jenny, it\\'s me. It\\'s your little brother.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"Jenny,\" I whisper, \"I can\\'t do this. I... I can\\'t do this.\" My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.\\n\\n\"Jenny, I need you,\" I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, \"I need my big sister.\"\\n\\nJenny doesn\\'t open her eyes.\\n\\n\"Please wake up,\" I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.\\n\\nShe\\'s the coldest thing I\\'ve ever touched in my life.\\n\\nI can\\'t be here. Men don\\'t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I\\'m done, I don\\'t feel like crying anymore. I\\'m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don\\'t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don\\'t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They\\'re also crying.\\n\\nI can\\'t cry. I\\'m the man here. I can\\'t cry. I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t be okay.\\n\\nMy room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren\\'t my friends here? Do I still have friends?\\n\\nI blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn\\'t my house. I\\'m in the city, not the village. There\\'s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny\\'s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.\\n\\nI want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn\\'t say anything. It\\'s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny\\'s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he\\'s the man who tried to make me support my granny.\\n\\nI read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.\\n\\nI\\'m naked and look at the bed. No one\\'s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don\\'t know. They might as well be dead.\\n\\nI don\\'t get dressed until I\\'ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven\\'t flushed since last night, and don\\'t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn\\'t I save them?\\n\\nI burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I\\'m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I\\'m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.\\n\\nI blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It\\'s the man from Jenny\\'s funeral. He\\'s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There\\'s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.\\n\\nThen I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They\\'ve changed. Where\\'s granda? I don\\'t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.\\n\\n\"I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord\\'s Chosen,\" she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, \"he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I say aloud then walk up to the bar. \"Hey, can you turn that up?\" I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. \"That\\'s my family on there.\" His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.\\n\\nI stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn\\'t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.\\n\\nThen it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he\\'d visited.\\n\\nMy heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.\\n\\nJenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.\\n\\nIt can\\'t be. It\\'s impossible. There\\'s no way that... no way that this man... \"Who is that?\" I ask when the black man is on the screen again.\\n\\n\"Calls himself the Prophet,\" the barman says, \"cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.\"\\n\\n\"Prophet,\" I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.\\n\\nHadn\\'t he asked to help invite people he thought would \"help\" with the funeral?\\n\\nWas he why my friends hadn\\'t come to the funeral?\\n\\nWhy had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he\\'d never met?\\n\\nWhy had he booked a room at granny\\'s hotel?\\n\\nWhy had he pushed me toward her?\\n\\nWhy had he been in the same room as my sister\\'s body?\\n\\nWhy had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?\\n\\nThe newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all \"good followers of the Way\" to help her in freeing her beloved.\\n\\nA picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.\\n\\nThat bastard.\\n\\nThat. Utter. Bastard.\\n\\nI shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.\\n\\nThere\\'s pictures of my home village on the screen. It\\'s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, \"Prophet, prophet,\" they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left\\n\\nThat isn\\'t the village I grew up in.\\n\\nThat\\'s what was built on top of it.\\n\\n\"Did they say where he\\'s being held?\" I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.\\n\\n\"No,\" the bartender said softly, \"but... look, son, I think I know what\\'s going through your head.\"\\n\\nI looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t go down that road. There\\'s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don\\'t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It\\'ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n\"It already has,\" I say softly, \"and it\\'s gotten my family now.\" My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I\\'m not going to work. I\\'ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I\\'ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.\\n\\nI know where the Prophet will be. He\\'ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn\\'t.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for a homecoming.',\n",

My heart clenches in my chest when I see the casket. My sister looks like she&amp;#39;s fat and made of clay, eyes closed and hands clasped across her chest. Her fingers are thin. She&amp;#39;s dressed in a beautiful white dress.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boy,&amp;quot; the black man says softly, his accent the same as my sister&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;this is a sad time for your family. You need to be in here with your grandmother to support her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glance at her. She&amp;#39;s still praying. Her eyes haven&amp;#39;t even opened. Her mouth just opened and repeated the rosary again and again. The people around her. I looked back at my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black ring bruised into her skin is evil. It wasn&amp;#39;t there when I found her. A blue rope made of cords was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I look back at the man. He stares into me then sighs. &amp;quot;Caoimhe,&amp;quot; he said, turning to my grandmother, &amp;quot;Caoimhe, your grandson is here.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m impressed he can pronounce her name. I still have some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Granny&amp;#39;s eyes open. There are no tears in them. She opens her mouth when she sees me. &amp;quot;Oh, Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;Ned, please come and sit beside me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say anything, because the man is pushing me toward her. She holds out her gloved hands and embraces me, pulling me down into the seat next to her. She holds me for a few seconds, patting my back. I can&amp;#39;t tell if she means it or not. Then she leans back and sighs for a moment. Her breath catches in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ned,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;I know this is a hard time for you. I know what it&amp;#39;s like to lose someone you&amp;#39;ve grown up with your whole life. Sometimes, you only get one older sibling to... to...&amp;quot; She stops and begins stuttering, her bottom lip quivering. She puts a hand to her mouth as tears start to rain down her cheeks. The other people, not a single one of them a family or friend of mine, surround and comfort her, patting her back and saying how it will all be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take my chance and sit up, but I don&amp;#39;t leave. I walk up to the open casket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My sister looks like she might wake up at any moment. My throat feels like a stone. My fingers tremble as I raise my hand slowly. Nobody&amp;#39;s paying any attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say in a whisper, &amp;quot;Jenny, can... can you hear me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She keeps her lips pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I say again, still whispering, &amp;quot;Jenny, it&amp;#39;s me. It&amp;#39;s your little brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny,&amp;quot; I whisper, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do this. I... I can&amp;#39;t do this.&amp;quot; My eyes feel wet. My lip shakes. The muscles of my chin contract together. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, I need you,&amp;quot; I whisper again, hand now hovering over her dead fingers, &amp;quot;I need my big sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny doesn&amp;#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wake up,&amp;quot; I say, lips curling into a frown as the tip of my finger touches her cold, clammy skin. I pull away instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s the coldest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever touched in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be here. Men don&amp;#39;t cry. I leave the room and rush back downstairs into the kitchen. I pick up the first stray glass of wine I can and drink it all in one go. By the time I&amp;#39;m done, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying anymore. I&amp;#39;m swaying. A hiccup escapes my mouth. People notice. I slowly leave, empty wine glass still in my hand. Back upstairs. I don&amp;#39;t care as I pass my still crying granny and a room full of strangers. I don&amp;#39;t care that my mother is crying while her sisters from America vainly comfort her. They&amp;#39;re also crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cry. I&amp;#39;m the man here. I can&amp;#39;t cry. I can&amp;#39;t do it. I can&amp;#39;t be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My room is still dark, curtains drawn. Why am I laying in my bed, an empty wine glass on my head? Why aren&amp;#39;t my friends here? Do I still have friends?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly, staring at the ceiling. This isn&amp;#39;t my house. I&amp;#39;m in the city, not the village. There&amp;#39;s still a wine glass on my hand. I sit up, set down the wine glass on the floor, and push myself off the bed. I check my phone. Granny&amp;#39;s sent another message about the People of the Way and their sessions. She says dad and mom will be attending. She wants me to get in touch with the American branch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to ask what happened to the hotel, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t say anything. It&amp;#39;s not hers anymore. The current owner was a friend she made during Jenny&amp;#39;s wake and subsequent funeral. I think he&amp;#39;s the man who tried to make me support my granny.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I read their little book. I hate it so much I burned it after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m naked and look at the bed. No one&amp;#39;s in there. A picture is framed on the bedside table of two smiling, naked children, a brother with his big sister, covered by white towels. Where are they now? I don&amp;#39;t know. They might as well be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get dressed until I&amp;#39;ve drunk an entire can of ginger ale. Then I drink another, and then a third. They join the pile in the corner. I take a piss in a toilet I haven&amp;#39;t flushed since last night, and don&amp;#39;t brush my teeth. I run my tongue through a gap between my front teeth where two more should be. Why didn&amp;#39;t I save them?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I burp before I get dressed. It makes my heartburn. Then I leave and walk to work. I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what my job is, just that I need to be sober for it. I&amp;#39;m drunk. I stop in a bar, waiting for it to pass. I look at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blink slowly and squint at it. I know a face on it. It&amp;#39;s the man from Jenny&amp;#39;s funeral. He&amp;#39;s wearing an orange jumpsuit. There&amp;#39;s a woman holding some paper and sitting behind a desk, talking about his victims who range in age from twelve to the age Jenny was when she took her own life. She says that his followers are going to post his bail.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see my granny, mother, and father on the TV. They&amp;#39;ve changed. Where&amp;#39;s granda? I don&amp;#39;t see granda. What happened to granda? I can hear granny talking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I simply cannot believe these allegations against one of the Lord&amp;#39;s Chosen,&amp;quot; she says, her thick Irish accent somehow comforting, &amp;quot;he showed us that even the death of our beloved Jenny had a purpose, that even despite her sins, she could be saved by our prayers. He has revitalized this village and changed it for the better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say aloud then walk up to the bar. &amp;quot;Hey, can you turn that up?&amp;quot; I point to the TV. He gives me a stink eye. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my family on there.&amp;quot; His stink eye vanishes and he does as I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare, mouth dropping open, as mom talks about how she found spiritual healing, how she found the way, and that she doesn&amp;#39;t need to grieve her daughter anymore. Dad is tall and stoic, without a glint in his eyes. I wonder what his breath smells like. Same as mine, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it cuts away to reveal the black man being led away in cuffs. He stands tall and proud, an arrogant look on his face. The newscaster begins explaining how police have uncovered evidence of vast abuse directed at several young girls who joined the People of the Way or expressed interest. She lists off the locations that he&amp;#39;d visited.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sinks when she says Detroit, roughly ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jenny had been in Detroit ten years ago before she died.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s impossible. There&amp;#39;s no way that... no way that this man... &amp;quot;Who is that?&amp;quot; I ask when the black man is on the screen again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Calls himself the Prophet,&amp;quot; the barman says, &amp;quot;cult leader accused of sexually abusing multiply women and girls, among other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prophet,&amp;quot; I taste the word. It tastes like a hunk of rotting meat in my mouth covered in maggots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hadn&amp;#39;t he asked to help invite people he thought would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Was he why my friends hadn&amp;#39;t come to the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been so supportive during the wake and funeral of a stranger he&amp;#39;d never met?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he booked a room at granny&amp;#39;s hotel?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he pushed me toward her?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been in the same room as my sister&amp;#39;s body?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why had he been looking at it? What had he been thinking?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster continues talking, explaining how his fiancee was appealing to all &amp;quot;good followers of the Way&amp;quot; to help her in freeing her beloved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A picture of my granny is on the screen. I lean back against the bar counter, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That. Utter. Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shake. Everything becomes a blur as the Prophet appears on the screen again, his arrogant face staring into me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s pictures of my home village on the screen. It&amp;#39;s not like I remember. Only a bunch of strangers holding placards and protesting. They say his name, a single chant, &amp;quot;Prophet, prophet,&amp;quot; they cry out. None of them were in the village when I left&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t the village I grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what was built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did they say where he&amp;#39;s being held?&amp;quot; I asked, a sick feeling forming in my chest. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the bartender said softly, &amp;quot;but... look, son, I think I know what&amp;#39;s going through your head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the bartender to find a grim expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it. Don&amp;#39;t go down that road. There&amp;#39;s no going back. I know it hurts, but you don&amp;#39;t want to make it worse. Grief, it destroys a person. It&amp;#39;ll destroy you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It already has,&amp;quot; I say softly, &amp;quot;and it&amp;#39;s gotten my family now.&amp;quot; My throat is a stone again. I get up and leave the bar. I&amp;#39;m not going to work. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money for a one-way ticket to Ireland. I&amp;#39;ve got enough money to stock a drawer full of knives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know where the Prophet will be. He&amp;#39;ll be in my home. In the village. I grew up in that place. The Prophet didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nI studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.\\n\\nNot a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.\\n\\nPurgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.\\n\\n10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.\\n\\nThe stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.\\n\\nHe led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.\\n\\nI begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.\\n\\nThe game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”\\n\\nI pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.\\n\\nI began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.\\n\\nThis was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.\\n\\nI panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I studied graphic design in college and learned a fair bit of coding on the side. The goal was to be a video game designer, but it turns out I’m not terribly artistic. A few years after college and I DID manage to get into the industry, only as a tester and not a designer. It was still a solid position in the career field I loved, and the dream job of every geek like me. Not to mention it paid fairly well. The office I was at was pretty well furnished for maximum geekery. The testing floor was an ocean of disheveled cubicles, humming with flashing screens, childish taunting and popping energy drinks. The break room was filled with classic gaming cabinets and stockpiled with junk food. The floor above us was development and design, and the floor above that was marketing and execs. The floor below us was the ground floor, composed of a reception office and security; you’d be surprised at how seriously these guys took security. I had been told there was a gym somewhere too but had no idea where. I was about two years into the job when I first heard there was a basement floor-a place the designers referred to as “Purgatory”, and it was the only floor not accessible by elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of the testers knew about it and getting any of the developers to share the details was like pulling teeth. They either feigned ignorance or told me it was above my paygrade. One even threatened to get me fired if I kept pushing it. It wasn’t until one late night at the office, after downing about half a bottle of rye with one of the designers (him way more than me), that I finally get someone to spill the proverbial beans. I think it also helped that he was about a week from retiring, so he didn’t really care what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Purgatory was essentially a floor dedicated to defunct title storage and disposal. Only a hand full of designers had ever been down there and are reportedly bound through contract to keep quiet about it. There are apparently hundreds of obscure projects that have been vetoed from production for one reason or another. The ones that the company decide to destroy are disassembled and liquidated, though they are apparently quite picky on what gets scrapped. The execs opt to keep most of the discontinued titles for reasons unknown. Perhaps to revisit them in the future or whatever. It took a bit more begging and a lot more alcohol to convince him to sneak me down there. He luckily knew the night security manager pretty well, who was a big fan of ‘supplemental income’.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later and we were on our way down, albeit $250 lighter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The stairs led into a wide, cavernous warehouse that looked like the floor of a wholesale club. Only, instead of large quantities of stuff for discount prices, it was lined all the way down with steel cages, more than I could count. They were about eight feet tall and as wide as a bookshelf, lined with row upon row of different gaming cartridges and discs. Each cage had an electronic lock that required a different pin-code to open. I had to cough up another $200 to get security to open one, which he did while assertively telling me not to touch anything. I was giggling like a little kid at the excitement of seeing the some of the missing links of the gaming world. The cage he opened was for the TurboGrafx-16, a pure gem from the console revolution. I had one of them growing up and knew every title like the back of my hand, or so I thought. The first few cartridges I perused had white mailing stickers in place of game art, each with a collective series of numbers and letter. A few had mock titles and dates scribbled below the serials: Sci-Fi platformania/shootem-1988 or RACETILLYOUDIE-1986. It wasn’t until the third or fourth row that one cartridge distinctly caught my eye: UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. Keep in mind that the TurboGrafx-16 had been well phased out by 1997, which means someone had designed this title purely for their own agenda. The guard was starting to get antsy now, so we locked the cage back up and headed upstairs. The next day, I returned to the office at night and gave the same guard $500 for another peak; I told you my job paid well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me downstairs, and I asked to see the same cage. I stepped through the doors and immediately went back to UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997. It took about two minutes for him to look away at the static of his radio, and I made my move, swapping the game out with a cartridge from my pocket I had doctored to look just like it. He was none the wiser. We headed back upstairs, and I jumped in my car and tore down the street like a maniac.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I begun live-streaming my recreational gaming sessions about six months prior, gathering a modest 300 followers or so. I blasted out a social media message while driving about a special event stream I would be hosting that night, revealing something no other gamer has seen. This was a terrible idea. Most of my followers were watching as I plugged in the mysterious cartridge and booted it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The game started on a black screen with big ballooned letters that said: “Press Start to Begin Purification!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pressed the button and the game emitted a noise that resembled a crying child. The game was in first-person perspective and played like those old point and click adventures. It started in an average looking home, with an inventory bar at the bottom of the screen and a numerical score bar at the top left. It was kind of plain in design but rendered in full color and had crisp sound effects. You could interact with the environment by moving your cursor over items or entering a different room. I heard that same child crying sound from the title screen about a minute into me exploring the kitchen, only this time it was softer and sounded muffled, like it came from a different room. One of my followers said they heard it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began clicking any discernible item I could see in each room I entered, the crying sound popping up every minute or so. I collected a knife, an umbrella, a rope, a bottle, a hammer, a box of matches, and a bottle of salicylic acid. I’m sure there was more items to find, but that sporadic crying sound had piqued my interest. I decided to pinpoint where it was coming from, which eventually led me to the basement door. Clicking on the door queued a grainy cinematic of my characters feet descending each step with a loud thud, all the while the muffled crying sound growing louder and clearer from the darkness at the bottom. When the sequence ended, I was standing in the basement and staring at something or someone that was chained to the wall, huddled and whimpering in the corner. My viewers exploded the comments in horror as we came to collective realization that it was a young boy. When I scrolled my cursor over the child, the word “Squeal” appeared over his head. Some of my followers immediately logged off from my stream, while others prompted me to interact with him. Clicking on the boy only made the crying louder for a moment. I tried to give him the hammer to break the chains but pressing the item against him created the sickening sound of bone crunching, followed by the boy shrieking. I nearly puked when I noticed the score bar increase by 100 points.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was a simulation for abusing and torturing a child.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked and killed the stream, tearing the cartridge from my game system and hurling it across the room. I debated calling the police but knew they would find out I stole the game, and I didn’t want to lose my job or end up in jail. It is just a game, after all. Maybe it would be best if I just swapped it back out and forgot this whole thing never happened. The next day at work, security was waiting for my in the lobby; someone had sent footage of my live stream to the company. I was forced to hand over the game and lost my job, threatened with a lawsuit for violating company policies and theft. The designer that told me about Purgatory was implicated as well and lost his entire pension. The security guard was also fired and threatened with legal action. That office relocated soon after, as did the entire collection of god-knows what kind of other defunct game titles. I don’t know what would prompt the company to keep something so terrible as UrUselessDogBoySqueal-1997, but they obviously didn’t want anyone knowing about it. What’s worse is that I distinctly remember seeing on the shelf next to that game a cartridge titled Return2Squeal-2019.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted Mr Letz as I wheeled the food cart into his compact room. The Alzheimer’s had taken a hold of him over the last few months and he no longer acknowledged me. \\n\\nI felt a pang of pity as I observed the old man sitting and staring at the drawn blinds, which he now did all day and most of the night. He looked small and childlike. When he was first brought in he was optimistic and talkative and stood tall. He used to tell me all about the adventures he had all over the world throughout his life, having never really settled down, and even recommended me places to go. He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.\\n\\n“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”\\n\\n“…*can you hear the screams.*” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.\\n\\nI knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”\\n\\n“…*I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home*?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “*I can’t see. Please, can I go home?*”\\n\\nAlzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.\\n\\n“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.\\n\\n“*I can’t see…*”\\n\\n“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. \\n\\nMr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”\\n\\nI released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”\\n\\nHis language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”\\n\\nI fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. \\n\\nThough I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nI googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.\\n\\n\"**FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!**\\n\\n*LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-\"*\\n\\nThere were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.\\n\\nMr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: *Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.*\\n\\nA little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.\\n\\nThe Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.\\n\\nIn 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…\\n\\nI was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. \\n\\nCome 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.\\n\\nA woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… \\n\\nI asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.\\n\\n“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“\\n\\n“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. \\n\\n“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“\\n\\n“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” \\n\\nHis tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”\\n\\nThe line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”\\n\\nI hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”\\n\\n“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”\\n\\n“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?\\n\\n“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”\\n\\n“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“\\n\\n“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”\\n\\nI was stunned into silence.\\n\\n“If you\\'re a journalist, you\\'re a bad one, but I don\\'t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”\\n\\nThe shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”\\n\\nThere was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO\\'s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. \\n\\nA dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. \\n\\nI went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.\\n\\n“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”\\n\\nI acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.\\n\\nI delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.\\n\\n“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.\\n\\n“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”\\n\\nHis eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.\\n\\nThough he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….\\n\\nSlowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.\\n\\nMr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. \\n\\nI took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.\\n\\nThey parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.\\n\\nMr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. \\n\\nI backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.\\n\\nFinally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.\\n\\nStunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.\\n\\nThe image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…\\n\\nI glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. \\n\\nHow much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.',\n",

He encouraged me to move beyond what I thought I could do and try something new. I admired him greatly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your favorite today - green Jell-o.” I placed his lunch on the table beside him. As I stood, he murmured something I didn’t quite catch. “Sorry, Mr Letz… what was that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;can you hear the screams.&lt;/em&gt;” He repeated in a whisper. It was the first time he’d spoken to me in over a week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt beside him; his eyes were watery and unfocused as if he were deep in a memory. “It’s Ok, you’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;I just want to go home. Please Mr, can I go home&lt;/em&gt;?” He muttered and turned his gaze to mine. “&lt;em&gt;I can’t see. Please, can I go home?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s patients often regress into memories. A way to soothe them is to play along and help out where you can. When Mr Letz began worrying about picking up his long deceased wife, I offered to fetch her for him. Immediately his anxiety was gone and he rarely brought her up again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Would you like more light?” I asked. He suddenly looked afraid, and it broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I can’t see…&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Let’s get some more light.” I rose to adjust the blinds, but the moment my hand fell upon them steely fingers with surprising strength gripped my other wrist. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz was leaning forward in his chair and staring up at me, his face contorted in a kind of grimace. “Don’t let them in.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I released the blinds and he released my wrist, sinking back into his chair, unfocused again. “Mustn’t let them in. They’re waiting just outside. Scratching. Tapping. They remember Flagstrad, that shit smear of a hole. Those cunting children that I took.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His language and intensity unsettled me. And the word “Flagstrad…” In the past he often spoke of all the places he had traveled, but never of Flagstrad. The name was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite remember why.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever heard a pig scream?” He asked solemnly. “That’s what they sound like, but with more sniveling. Much more sniveling… Don’t you dare open them!” He demanded again, fire behind his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s OK, I won’t open the blinds.” I soothed as best I could, and he looked up at me with a sudden twinkle of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, dear boy. I’m hungry. I’d like some jell-o please. Green jell-o, if you wouldn’t mind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fetched the jell-o off his table and he contentedly spooned it into his mouth, eyes still trained on the blinds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though I’m used to mood swings from my patients, Mr Letz’s disturbing outburst stubbornly remained with me for the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I googled Flagstrad when I got home, and the reason I was vaguely familiar of it came back to me. As a kid my family and I had holidayed in a village nearby in the 90s, and my mother, who usually encouraged exploration, had been very strict about where I went. I remembered being annoyed at her… Now I understood why she was so over protective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;FLAGSTRAD CURSE STRIKES AGAIN!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaFontaine children still missing. Citizens of Trent: Lucy, 8, Judith, 5, and Kent, 12, were last seen playing by the stream which dissects Trent and flows into Flagstrad. Hysterical, their parents have made several public appeals for the return of their children-&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were other articles - seven more in fact, each one noting the disappearance of a child or children who had played somewhere within or near Flagstrad, never to be seen again. All dated from 1960 to 1975, where they abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz’s words filled my mind and a chill crawled along my spine when scrolling further, I discovered an image of a grand, historical looking building, the subtitle proclaiming: &lt;em&gt;Letz Inn Brings Back Welcome Tourism To Flagstrad – 1955.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A little voice in my head chirped that this was all just a coincidence, and I truly hoped that was the case, but as I delved deeper, my uneasiness rose.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Letz inn had been in Flagstrad for two generations. The first – dispelling the notion of coincidence – was headed by an Augustus Avery Letz. The same Augustus Letz I had tended to for over two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the ownership was transferred to a Fredrik Letz, the only son of Augustus. Augustus was not mentioned from that date onward in any article or advertisement for the inn…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glued to my computer for hours that night, pouring over any and every piece of information about Flagstrad and the Inn that had been digitized. Though the subject was grim, I hadn’t felt so driven in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Come 9 pm, having exhausted all avenues online that I could, I decided to make a call. I knew I was crossing a line, that I should just hand anything I knew to the police, even if they laughed in my face, which considering what I had to go on was likely. But I just couldn’t drop it… I couldn’t go to bed without seeing this through. So I made the call… I dialed the Letz Inn, as I couldn’t find any other direct listing for Fredrik.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A woman answered. She sounded cheery and young and told me that the Inn was closed for the night, but I could make a reservation… &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if I could speak to Fredrik, and she informed me that he did not take calls regarding queries. Using the most authoritative voice I could muster, I told her it was actually in regards to his father’s health. Perhaps a more experienced person would have questioned why I didn’t call him directly, as well as every other fault in my story... but instead she asked me to hold, and the next thing I knew a quiet but firm voice was on the other line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is Fredrik Letz.” He stated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… I’m one of the caretakers looking after your father at the Clearwater Aged-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is he dead?” He spoke as if asking about the weather. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no, sir, I’m sorry to have given that impression-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My agreement with your facility explicitly states I am only to be contacted in the event of my father’s death.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His tone took an icy turn. Sensing he was about to hang up, I blurted whatever I could to keep him on the line: “Your family is connected to the Flagstrad curse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The line fell silent, the only clue he hadn’t hung up being the lack of dial tone. He was listening, so I went on, “Your father made a very concerning comment, one that bothered me greatly.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “And your name is?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, and then decided on a whim that it might be best to lie. “Gerald White. Sir, your father mentioned taking Flagstrad children… I have done a small amount of research and discovered he lived there for over a decade. During that time-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then you should know my father, and our family, was already investigated and cleared. Twice.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No sir, I did not know that.” I replied, thrown, and to be honest feeling like a fool. What exactly had I thought I’d accomplish with this call?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My father is a very sick man. He cannot be beholden to anything he might say, now can he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, probably not…” I faltered, but then the doggedness that I had felt all through the evening returned. I have no idea where it came from. “But I believe there is something here, Mr Letz, something worth digging up. I have no idea of your involvement-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now you listen to me,” he hissed, and his voice took an edge that mirrored Augustus’. “I pray for my father’s death. The world will be a better place, I assure you. I will have him incinerated, and then I will flush the ashes down the closest toilet, where they belong.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was stunned into silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you&amp;#39;re a journalist, you&amp;#39;re a bad one, but I don&amp;#39;t believe you are… The Letz’s have owned a sizable chunk of Flagstrad for a very long time. That is just one page in our portfolio. Perhaps you should research my uncle, and my aunt, or my cousins. Take your pick. We have been investigated, twice. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The shoe took a moment to fall, but it did, eventually. “Yes, I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a click and dial tone filled the line. I suddenly felt very tired. A quick google of the people he had mentioned yielded the results of powerful CEO&amp;#39;s, politicians, and judges spread country wide, and some even abroad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shadow had been cast over Flagstrad by the Letz household all those years ago, and whatever happened, it was long covered up. A powerful family with everything to lose made sure no one would ever know the truth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went into work the next morning drained. A colleague collared me on the way in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you heard the news?” she whispered conspiratorially. “The boss is on a rampage looking for an employee who called one of the patient’s families. He didn’t do into details but… damn! The fam must have made a Hell of a complaint. Whoever did it is gonna be out of a job, no doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I acted intrigued and then made my excuses. Thank God I had lied about my name… I could only hope that would be enough. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, it was enough, plus my exemplary record paid off for once. The boss only briefly questioned me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I delivered Mr Letz his lunch at noon. He was in his chair - as always - staring at the drawn blinds. I couldn’t help but view him with new, suspicious eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” I greeted. He didn’t respond as I set his lunch down. I stood and observed him a moment before crouching down to his level.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mr Letz… you remember Flagstrad, don’t you?” There was no reaction, and again driven by this strange doggedness, I repeated the question more sternly. “The children in Flagstrad, Mr Letz. Do you remember them?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes flickered to mine. “Oh yes, yes… Of course I remember them.” His voice was frail and pitiful. “They are mad. Very mad at me, for what I did.” A thin smile curved his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though he was in the clutches of a terrible, mind altering disease, I knew that he had unwittingly spoken the truth. He had done something to all of those kids, all that time ago. Perhaps his son found out… Someone in the family certainly had. He had been usurped, then, and sent away. There would never be any justice… he would never suffer the consequences….&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, automatically, I moved to the side of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz hitched up his tartan knit blanket with his thinned fingers and blinked heavily, looking at me with the same detached interest as a newborn baby. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took the blind’s pull string in my hand and yanked it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They parted at once; the brilliant afternoon sun bathing every inch of the room, and man, before it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Letz froze staring at the window, his eyes instantly bulging in their sockets, and his mouth drawn into a horrible yawn as if to scream, but no sound came. He gasped for breath and bucked upward, rocking his chair until it teetered at tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I backed into the wall. I don’t what had possessed me to do what I did… I still don’t. Horrified, I watched Mr Letz writhe in place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the chair came thumping back down. Mr Letz batted at the air in front of him, and then he died. Just like that, frozen in a moment of terror, fingers twisted, yawning that terrible yawn, bug eyed and staring at some unseen horror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t realized I’d been holding my breath the entire time.  Inhaling long and deep, I drew the courage to ease my way to Mr Letz’s body, placing a finger on his pallid neck. I needn’t have, but it was policy. His file was marked Do Not Revive by next of kin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stunned, I hurriedly made my way out of the room to raise the alarm, but found myself lingering at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The image of a group of young victims flashed though my mind, their little bodies in whatever wretched state he left them in, standing right there at the window behind me, impossible, but there nonetheless, tapping, watching, and waiting…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back, unable to resist some sick curiosity no matter how afraid I was, no matter how much my better judgement screamed at me not to… there was nothing out there but a courtyard and a gentle breeze. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How much poison blood remains in the Letz family, if any, I don’t know, and I never will. I can only pray that the “curse” died with the old man, and that his victims have found peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I don\\'t know what uttered me to spit out those few words, I didn\\'t want to know what they meant. Am I gonna be next? What\\'s gonna happen to me? Who is this? This isn\\'t Mr. McWright anymore. I slowly moved my hand, and held on to what I could make out, was its hand. I fought for control over my own body, I don\\'t even know if it\\'s me that\\'s moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, kid!\"\\n\\nMr. Smith, Mr. McWright\\'s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it\\'s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could\\'ve happened to me, if it wasn\\'t for Mr. Smith.\\n\\nIt was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn\\'t for me, he would\\'ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn\\'t the principal speaking.\\n\\nWe heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?\\n\\nI hadn\\'t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I\\'d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn\\'t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?\\n\\nIt was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m next.\"\\n\\nI opened the door, and saw that there wasn\\'t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I\\'m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they\\'re everywhere.\\n\\nI saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. \\n\\n\"OP! Where are your classmates? Aren\\'t they supposed to be here? Didn\\'t the principal all tell you?\"\\n\\nThe principal? Wasn\\'t the principal already dead?\\n\\n\"Hey Finn, where\\'s your homeroom adviser?\"\\n\\n\"Dead, we\\'d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn\\'t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one\\'s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.\"\\n\\n\"I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?\"\\n\\nI presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.\\n\\nWe brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.\\n\\nWe were outsmarted, Finn\\'s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.\\n\\nAnd then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn\\'t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn\\'t move, couldn\\'t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it\\'s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I\\'ve ever felt. I\\'m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.\\n\\nI could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don\\'t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.\\n\\nAnd it burst itself out.\\n\\nI\\'m one of them now.\\n\\nI must do what I have to do.\\n\\nI must.',\n",

I fought for control over my own body, I don&amp;#39;t even know if it&amp;#39;s me that&amp;#39;s moving anymore, someone please, help me. Please help-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it, kid!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith, Mr. McWright&amp;#39;s associate, was the one who yelled it out loud. What was he thinking? I snapped back and regained control over my muscles, I hurriedly closed the door and locked it from the inside with my foot. I can hear it&amp;#39;s footsteps, heading towards the direction of the front door, where Mr. Smith was. I peeked through the opening of my locker door, and I saw the most horrifying thing, that could&amp;#39;ve happened to me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for Mr. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was clenching Mr. Smith from the neck, its tentacles were slowly moving towards his associates leg. I heard the loud gasps from my classmates, also terrified at what they were seeing. I felt terrible, it was because of me, if it wasn&amp;#39;t for me, he would&amp;#39;ve still been alive. From the corner of my eye, I saw more guys in hazmat suits, walk in the classroom and threatening the creature with some sort of machine. The intercom started again, but to our surprise, it wasn&amp;#39;t the principal speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We heard screaming, gurgling, teeth clenching, and banging. It was probably the worst combination of sounds you could hear in a situation like this. If the principal encountered one of these things, then could it be..?\\nThese things, are all over the school. The schools gates were all positioned in the main area of the city. Then that would mean, that the creatures are also all over the city?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t realized until now, but I was muttering. I was talking all about the things I had thought about, it was making me insane, I keep thinking that I&amp;#39;d come back here tomorrow, the same exact thing will happen, and nothing will ever change. Isn&amp;#39;t that what Insanity is about? Repeating something over and over again and expecting a different outcome?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was right outside my door. It was looking inside the opening. It was staring right into my eyes, straight in my soul. My body went into that limp, uncontrollable state again, and I yelled without me thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m next.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door, and saw that there wasn&amp;#39;t only one, but two creatures now, the guys in hazmat suits were all lying down on the floor, lifeless. The extent of what these creatures can do is right before my eyes, and I&amp;#39;m next. I stepped out my locker, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, I could all hear my classmates shrug in confusion as to what I was doing. I left the classroom and proceeded directly to the 1st Gate. Holy crap, they&amp;#39;re everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my friend, Finn, from Class 1-A, also outside and running, but this time he was with his classmates. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OP! Where are your classmates? Aren&amp;#39;t they supposed to be here? Didn&amp;#39;t the principal all tell you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The principal? Wasn&amp;#39;t the principal already dead?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Finn, where&amp;#39;s your homeroom adviser?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dead, we&amp;#39;d rather not talk about it now. These things are everywhere and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that the infection will stop. They said it was a low-lying virus, similar to the Corona, but this one&amp;#39;s much stronger and infects the whole body and mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can go get my classmates, but two of those creatures are right outside my room. Maybe some of you can come with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I presented a plan that has been going on in my mind for a couple of times now. I noticed that in those creatures mouth, there were some sort of yellow bulb. When I looked out the gate, all the creatures that were lying on the ground lifeless had those bulbs popped out. I thought that it would have something to do with how it stays alive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We brought some metal pipes, one of the kids managed to open the supply closet and snatch a crowbar, and we were on our way. Right off the bat, we were put face-to-face with one of them. None of us knew how to fight, and all of us were slim weaklings anyway. But still, we fought, poorly. I wished I could say that I jumped in my instincts and immediately smashed that bulb and beat it up. But no.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were outsmarted, Finn&amp;#39;s other classmate was already dead, it was only the two of us left.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then it grabbed my leg, and I was limp again, but this time, it felt kind of, permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t feel anything, it buried its fingers on my leg, clenching and scratching all over my leg. It was bleeding, a lot, but I couldn&amp;#39;t feel anything. It was terrifying, horrible, disgusting, everything you could describe it. Its fingers were swollen, and something fluid was entering the wound. I panicked, but I couldn&amp;#39;t move, couldn&amp;#39;t do anything. Finn, just stood there, after a while, he ran away. I was left alone with one of these creatures, I just looked into it&amp;#39;s eyes, and it started right back at me. I was able to get a portion of my senses, right just above my knee. It hurt, it hurt more than anything I&amp;#39;ve ever felt. I&amp;#39;m bleeding, and it was injecting something inside my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel myself, becoming one of them. It slowly started hurt lesser than before. I was disgusted to say, but I was getting used to it. I don&amp;#39;t even feel human anymore. Was I going insane? My head was feeling tingly, it stopped doing things to my leg, and I could feel my body again. But it was different, I felt hazy, slightly, comfortable. Something in my head kept moving around, it reached the top of my skull.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it burst itself out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of them now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I must do what I have to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I must.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn\\'t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.\\n\\nI met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.\\n\\nOur college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. \\n\\nThat is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.\\n\\nRyan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he\\'s okay, to which he replied: \"Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...\". Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with \"What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?\" He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn\\'t want to press it.\\n\\nOver the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn\\'t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn\\'t home he didn\\'t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.\\n\\nOne day when he wasn\\'t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what\\'s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn\\'t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said \"You need to return. It is time\" and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMonths went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.\\n\\nFast forward to two years later.\\n\\nAfter I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...\\n\\nThat was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn\\'t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan\\'s voice, so clearly, saying \"You need to return. It is time.\".\\n\\nI woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn\\'t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan\\'s words...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn\\'t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. \\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nNo answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.\\n\\nJust like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.\\n\\nOne night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: \"You need to return. It is time.\" \\n\\nMy brain couldn\\'t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn\\'t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.\\n\\nMonths passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.\\n\\n That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan\\'s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\n\\\\- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don\\'t remember but It\\'s me. Jessica.\\n\\nStrange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?\\n\\n\\\\- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?\\n\\n\\\\- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.\\n\\n\\\\- What? What are you talking abou-\\n\\n\\\\-  You need to return. It is time.\\n\\nThen she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.\\n\\nEver since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan\\'s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan\\'s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn\\'t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.\\n\\nDays passed. I patiently waited for the cops to \"solve the mystery\". Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn\\'t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. \\n\\nI thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...\\n\\nI booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said \"Ok\" and didn\\'t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he \"finished his task\" and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. \" I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.\" then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStreets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn\\'t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent\\'s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called \"the enlightenment\" to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. \"You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it\\'s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.\" he said before disappering into the void...\\n\\nI woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn\\'t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...\"ok\" and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I\\'d say they normally would ask more questions. \\n\\nIt was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. \\n\\nIt took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: \" Read the book and you will know everything.\"\\n\\nIt was the quickest and biggest \"nope\" of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan\\'s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.\\n\\nA few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn\\'t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.\\n\\n\\\\- Hello?\\n\\nA familiar voice spoke:\\n\\n\\\\- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I\\'ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...\\n\\nHung up.\\n\\nI thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the \"consequences\"? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn\\'t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: \"Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute\". I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. \"Emma, are you in there?\" No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.\\n\\nI opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:\\n\\n\"Now the price is paid.\"',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family and I lived in a small neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. My mom, dad, grandma and grandpa, our family dog, and me. Our neighborhood was usually quiet and calm, aside from a few teenagers occasionally getting drunk and causing trouble, we didn&amp;#39;t have much ruckus in our small, monotonous lives. I grew up there and had a seemingly normal childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met Ryan when I was six. My mom used to take me to the playground on weekends. When I first saw him I thought he was a fairly goofy kid. We were the same age and instantly formed a special bond, went to the same elementary school, middle school, high school and then; -by conscious effort- same college in Louisiana. I decided to major in computer science while  Ryan chose finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our college had a mandatory one-year campus residence policy for freshmen. Of course, Ryan and I requested to be roomed together but were denied. At least we were assigned to the same floor. When I first moved into the dorm and met my new roommate Greg, l thought he was a fairly cool guy. That‘s what you think about most people when you first meet them. Until of course, you get to know them... Unbeknownst to me was that Greg was actually the most socially inept and awkward person I ever met in my life. I dreaded every day I had to live with that jerk and my only solace was Ryan being close. Needless to say, we moved into an off- campus apartment the second year. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is when all these strange occurrences started happening. Up until this point our lives had been mostly uneventful with occasional ups and downs. l was generally happy, performing well in grades, had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a retail store to help me with my tuition. And my relationship with my then-girlfriend Jessica was getting pretty serious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan however, started acting...strange. At first, I chalked it up to the stress of change in our lives. But he acted more and more bizarre as time went by. One day I came home to find Ryan pacing up and down in the living room. I asked if he&amp;#39;s okay, to which he replied: &amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I was just...thinking about... something...&amp;quot;. Naturally, I got curious about what he was thinking so I replied with &amp;quot;What exactly are you thinking about so feverishly?&amp;quot; He turned around and stared at me for a brief moment and went to his room. I got weirded out by this, of course, but didn&amp;#39;t want to press it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ryan and I grew more and more distant, he spent most of his time locked up in his room, doing God-knows-what. We talked less and less every day. After a while, I started to suspect that he stopped going to class too. Sometimes he didn&amp;#39;t come home for days or even weeks and never picked up my calls during these episodes. When he came back, it was usually at dead hours of the night like 3 AM or something, carrying large piles of books and stacks of paper. None of the books had anything on their cover. He would always give vague answers to my questioning too. Whenever he wasn&amp;#39;t home he didn&amp;#39;t come for days and whenever he was, he never got out of his room. This went on for two years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day when he wasn&amp;#39;t home I decided to break into his room in hopes of finding what&amp;#39;s up. I figured I would just break the lock on the old rusty door and have it repaired before he came back. No matter how hard I tried, the lock didn&amp;#39;t break and I had to break the door altogether. Holy. Christ. The room was an absolute mess, with sheets of paper tossed around all across the room. Piles of large and small books blocking the entrance and the window. Nothing on the papers or the books was legible. It was like some kind of mysterious made-up language with strange letters. Just when I was trying to gather my thoughts about the situation, the apartment door opened. It was Ryan. He did not have any books or papers with him this time. He immediately saw me in his room and rushed in. We gazed at each other in disbelief for a good minute until he said &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time&amp;quot; and turned around. Walked back to the apartment door and left. That was the last time I saw Ryan for the next three years...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. His family would call me every day in case there is a development in the search. For the first few weeks, I just thought it was another long episode of absence. It took me a good month and the fact that his number was no longer in use, and that none of our common friends had heard of him before I filed a missing person report and notified his family back in Colorado. Police questioned me a billion times along with many people in our college. No avail. He was nowhere to be found, just vanished without a trace. Eventually, the search efforts died down and I was tired as well. The stress of the whole situation took a toll on my relationship with Jessica and we broke up not long after.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I took on a job offer and decided to move to Seattle and put all of this behind, to start a new chapter in my life. As hard as that sounds. I got a new job as a programmer in a large company, got a new girlfriend named Emma. And started to slowly forget about the apartment in Lousiana, about the strange books and papers, about Ryan...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until one night. One night I had the most vivid dream I had in my life. I saw my old neighborhood, back in times of childhood. Ryan and I had a little treehouse which I didn&amp;#39;t remember up until now. But I saw it so vividly in the dream. It was filled with the same, black-covered books and stacks of paper, all written with some bizarre text in the same weird language. I suddenly was inside the treehouse, on top of the book pile. And I fell, into what seemed like an endless black void out of the treehouse. Then I heard... I heard Ryan&amp;#39;s voice, so clearly, saying &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in terror. It was 3:30. My girlfriend was fast asleep near me and I got up to have a glass of water. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind off of the nightmare. And Ryan&amp;#39;s words...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The same nightmare became more and more frequent as time went by and I couldn&amp;#39;t get proper sleep anymore. I started taking sleeping pills which helped a little bit. One night, I had a call with no caller id,  picked it up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. All I heard was some nauseating static noise. I hanged up the phone and went to bed. Hopelessly waiting for sleep to come.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the nightmare, the phone call started to happen more and more frequently as well. The second time, I hesitated to even pick up. It was the same call, at the same time of the night, again; no caller ID. Again, endless, hypnotizing, static noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night I woke up after the same nightmare. I saw my phone buzzing near the bed. No caller ID. I picked it up, heard the same static noise. But instead of hanging up immediately, I decided to wait. After what felt like an eternity, the static ended. And I heard a familiar voice: &amp;quot;You need to return. It is time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brain couldn&amp;#39;t exactly put the pieces together. Was Ryan still alive? If so, then he was still a nutjob. And worse is, he was a nutjob who now stalked me. What he said was the same as what he said before he left. What did he mean by that? Where do I exactly need to return to? So many questions boggled my mind. I eventually decided not to think too much of it. If he is somewhere out there, he will surface eventually. If he doesn&amp;#39;t, I can just stop caring about the calls and that would be it. I figured that nightmares were also a product of my stress about the whole thing, and I decided to stop picking up calls without a caller ID after that. And to see a therapist if nightmares persist.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed by without an incident. My nightmares gradually faded away and I returned to my normal life. Things were finally looking up. I received a big promotion at work and Emma and I started to make plans for marriage. I started to feel happy and somehow in peace after all that time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I received a strange mail one day. It was a piece of paper. Contained some weird shapes and figures. After examining it a little bit, I noticed that these shapes were similar to the ones on Ryan&amp;#39;s strange books and papers. Just after I was done with them, I got a call from an unknown number. I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Oh, hi Marcus. You probably don&amp;#39;t remember but It&amp;#39;s me. Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strange. It was her voice all right. Why would she call me after all this time?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Well, hi. What do you want Jessica?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- I just wanted to tell you that, the answer is sometimes closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- What? What are you talking abou-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-  You need to return. It is time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then she hanged up. Ryan the Sicko was now partners with... my ex girlfriend? All the more confusion to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I received that mail I started finding more of those papers all around my house, my office and even in my car. Someone was deliberately putting them in there. I called the cops and gave them a brief summary of the situation. Another investigation started. Ryan&amp;#39;s family and other people he was close to were thoroughly questioned, and that included me too. Sometime during these events, I got a call from... Ryan&amp;#39;s mom. After a regular exchange of info on Ryan, her voice suddenly changed. She told me... to return. In a way that seemed oddly familiar... I didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions, just said goodbye and hanged up the phone.  I tried not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Days passed. I patiently waited for the cops to &amp;quot;solve the mystery&amp;quot;. Big mistake I guess because the investigation brought up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence about the papers, no camera footage, no fingerprints, nothing. They also failed to decrypt the contents of the papers. And to top it all off, my nightmares returned during all of this to torment me. The same nightmare, Ryan was calling me. Telling me to return. The treehouse. I needed to... visit the old treehouse. Since police couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, It was up to me to find him and confront him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the treehouse for a while, Ryan and I built it together. We always used to play there, read comics and just goof off after school. I kissed my first girlfriend up there back in high school. Some of the fondest memories of my childhood was spending time there with my friends...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I booked up the flight the next day. As I was packing up, Emma came and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was planning to make a short visit to my family back in Colorado. She just said &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t ask any questions. Considering her inquisitive nature, that was fairly odd. But I brushed it off and went to sleep. I was too tired to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in months, I had a different dream. It was... the playground that we used to play together. I saw Ryan, his-six-year old self this time. At first, the dream was an exact flashback of our first meeting. But then it changed. We slowly floated up to the sky, as the playground grew smaller and smaller. Ryan told me that he &amp;quot;finished his task&amp;quot; and it was now up to me to continue what was necessary. &amp;quot; I chose you because I trusted you the most. You were my best friend. I believe you can pass on the truth.&amp;quot; then I woke up to the sound of my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Streets of my old neighborhood. It felt like a lifetime since I was last here. Everything was as dull, gray and lifeless as it always been. I guess I didn&amp;#39;t notice it so much as a child. My family was delighted to see me. And frankly, I was too. It put my mind at a little bit of ease to see my mom and dad again during this whole ordeal. I spent the whole day in my childhood home and with my parents. The next day I paid a visit to my grandparent&amp;#39;s graves. I was reluctant, perhaps afraid, to do what I really came here to do. That night I woke up from another vivid dream. In the dream, we were in our college home. Ryan explained to me how he worked so hard to spread what he called &amp;quot;the enlightenment&amp;quot; to everyone around us. Me being the only exception. But now he fulfilled his duty and chose me to continue where he had left off. &amp;quot;You need to take the books and study them to learn about the truth, I know it&amp;#39;s confusing but just keep trying to read them and you will understand in time.&amp;quot; he said before disappering into the void...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and had an incredible urge to just go there, I couldn&amp;#39;t procrastinate anymore. I had to visit the treehouse. Just when I was leaving, my parents both came down asked me where I was going, I told them I just wanted some fresh air and they just said...&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and went back upstairs. Odd. Knowing them, I&amp;#39;d say they normally would ask more questions. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly night. I parked my car on the side of the road and entered the woods. Trudging through the darkness with a flashlight, I felt all kinds of feelings all at once, becoming more and more uneasy as I came closer to my destination. There it was, the treehouse. I had all kinds of voices in my head as I climbed up the creaky old wooden ladder. It was as if my soul was internally screaming. I reached the floor. Got up, looked around and sure enough; Ryan stockpiled loads of those strange black books and papers inside the treehouse. I turned the flashlight around and saw Ryan, hanging from the ceiling from his neck, with a thick rope covered in what looked like blood. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to snap out of the shock and come back to my senses. I continued to look around. In front of him was an old wooden table, a book was placed on it with a bloody knife near it. The book, however, was different than the others. It had a bright red cover instead of pitch black. A small piece of paper was placed on it. A note: &amp;quot; Read the book and you will know everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the quickest and biggest &amp;quot;nope&amp;quot; of my life. I threw the book and rushed down, out of the treehouse. I ran past the dark woods back to my car, drove back to my house, went in the garage, got a can of gas and a bucket of water and rushed back to the treehouse. Poured the gas inside and outside, all around the crude structure. Fortunately, we built this thing in a part of the forest where trees were more scarce. Though I was a little scared that fire could spread to the trees, it did not hold me back from lighting up the matches and throwing them. Burning the whole treehouse to the ground with everything in it. Including Ryan&amp;#39;s body. I was determined to finish this right there and then. The treehouse crumbled and crashed with a loud sound of woods snapping. Before I could catch my breath, it turned into a big pile of burnt rubble. I splashed water and dirt to silence the flames and took a moment to breathe. It was over. Ryan was dead and whatever secrets he had in those books -which he wanted me to learn- was gone with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later; I got a call. I looked at the screen; No caller ID. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick up but this time curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar voice spoke:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;- Hello, Marcus. I have to say, I was honestly surprised and... disappointed. Considering everything I&amp;#39;ve done to enlighten you. You refused the gift and the sacrifice, so now you need to make a sacrifice; to pay the price. You need to pay the consequences...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about that conversation over and over.  Who was that? Did Ryan had a partner? What were the &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot;? It cluttered my mind for quite some time. Although after a while, I forgot about it because... nothing actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since that night. I greatly enjoyed the well-earned peace and quiet since. Me and Emma were finally getting married. I felt a tornado of emotions during the wedding day. It was a huge ceremony attended by a massive network of friends and family. After the wedding, we wanted to throw a party that night to celebrate. Just when we were having fun and guests were enjoying their drinks, I felt overwhelmed by the crowd and decided to go out to the yard to get some fresh air. After I got back inside, my eyes searched for Emma a little bit but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her. I asked her mom where she is and she said: &amp;quot;Oh Emma went to her room to grab something, dear. She will be back in a minute&amp;quot;. I waited for a lot longer than a minute before I finally decided to go check up on her. I went upstairs to our room and knocked twice. &amp;quot;Emma, are you in there?&amp;quot; No answer, even though the lights were on.  I waited for a little longer and then decided to just go in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to see my wife hanging from the ceiling from her neck, with a thick rope covered in blood. A note was attached to her dress which said:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now the price is paid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'As I listened to the radio driving in my beat up car, I couldn’t help but think about seeing my mom,dad, and sister for the first time since leaving for university. This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time. I pulled into the parking garage and found a spot not too clogged with the amount of cars that would surprise anyone considering the time. With a turn of my key in the ignition, my car shut down with a tired gasp. \\nI approached the doors of the airport surprised at the amount of inactivity in the drop-off zone. I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. \\n\\nI took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. \\n\\nI left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.\\nI went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  \\n\\nAs I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. \\n“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. \\n\\nThe clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall. I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.\\n\\nI exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before. I continued in my day contemplating what just happened until I sat down in the Boeing 737. The man I was sitting next to had a musky smelling cologne,white wrinkly fingers and some black dress shoes.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I listened to the radio driving in my beat up car, I couldn’t help but think about seeing my mom,dad, and sister for the first time since leaving for university. This thought was sunshine radiating in the dark and sad setting of Detroit at 1:53 in the morning. My flight was at 2:45 and so I woke up early and was confident that I’d make it on time. I pulled into the parking garage and found a spot not too clogged with the amount of cars that would surprise anyone considering the time. With a turn of my key in the ignition, my car shut down with a tired gasp. \\nI approached the doors of the airport surprised at the amount of inactivity in the drop-off zone. I tugged my red suitcase behind me as I glided towards the terminal. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took a curious glance around the ticket counter and was genuinely confused as to where everyone was. “Had something happened, was there some sort of evacuation that I hadn’t known about?” As I was contemplating these ideas and questions I heard a faint and steady clicking, it sounded as if someone with tap dancing shoes was walking. “Great! Someone that could help me,” I thought. But, as the clicking became slightly louder and faster I felt that the person these sounds belonged to was a devil in disguise. It was a feeling you can’t describe or explain. I believe it’s a part of your fight or flight intuition. In this situation, I decided to fly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I left my things next to a gray bench at the entrance and began walking away from the sound. At first, I passed the ticket booths but as the sound turned from a clicking into a stomping-run I ran towards the metal detectors. I ran straight through, caring more for myself than how much trouble I could get into. The sound seemed to be following me and yet, when I looked behind, there was no one. I slowed to a jog, but the running didn’t.\\nI went into a full sprint as I passed the restaurants in the airport plaza. This ‘thing’ seemed to slow after a few minutes thanks to my time as a track long-distance runner in high school. However, I wasn’t going to slow until I felt confident.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I rounded the corner I spyed a bathroom and made a dumb decision of hiding In there. I slid under the door of the stall and hopped onto the toilet. It was a solid 5 minutes before I heard the clicking again. It was as calm and quiet as I heard it when I entered the airport. \\n“What had happened? Why is no one here? Is no one here because of this thing?” The clicking got louder and sounded closer and I soon realized that I should’ve left the airport when I was ahead. The clicking was coming closer and I wish that I took this flight sooner so I could’ve seen my family one last time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The clicking stopped. I looked at the bottom of the door and saw some black dress shoes. The man with the shoes tapped on my door 3 times and I asked in a scared and shaken tone, “what do you want?” It was then that the most violent shaking I’ve ever felt was centered on my stall. 2 bone-White wrinkly hands were on the stall door, and although those hands looked old they had the force and power to shake my whole stall. I lept off the toilet lid and ducked down into the stall next to me thinking that that would help me. My mind was racing so fast and I was thinking about so much that I didn’t realize that the shaking stopped. I looked under the stalls and behold, no shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I exited the stall to a busy food court, a sprawling airport compared to the one I was met with minutes before. I continued in my day contemplating what just happened until I sat down in the Boeing 737. The man I was sitting next to had a musky smelling cologne,white wrinkly fingers and some black dress shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '\\n\\n[Part Three](https://redd.it/f5gpg9)\\n\\n**** \\n\\n“Are you ready to begin?”\\n\\nI flinched at the words as I looked up at the man seated across from me.  He wore a brown suit that looked a little large for him, the coat sleeves trailing past his wrists to lap against his hands as he settled back into his chair.  Despite his formal dress, he seemed relaxed.  Pleasant.  And entirely focused on me.  I found the intensity of his gaze unsettling, but I was more troubled by my own confusion.  I wasn’t sure where I was or what was going on.  And I wasn’t entirely clear on what we were supposed to be starting.\\n\\nThe man seemed to pick up on my confusion.  Giving me a congenial smile, he began on his own.\\n\\n“Daniel, I can sense that you are out-of-sorts.  That is understandable.  For a number of years you have, among other issues, been prone to periodically entering fugue states that typically include temporary retrograde amnesia.  It is my belief that you are in one of those fugues now.”\\n\\nI frowned.  “So what, you’re saying I’m crazy or something?”\\n\\nThe man’s lips twitched slightly, though I wasn’t sure if his expression had become more of a smirk or a grimace.  “Or something, I suppose.  We don’t use the term ‘crazy’, and in any case, you have a multitude of facets to your condition.  Frankly, the periods of confusion and memory loss may be the least interesting.”\\n\\n“Who are you?  Some kind of psychologist?”\\n\\nThe man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t *want* to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”\\n\\n“What?  What *are* you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”\\n\\nThis time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”\\n\\nI nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”\\n\\n“What do you think happened to her?”\\n\\nI felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.\\n\\nBut then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.\\n\\n“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”\\n\\nThe man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”\\n\\nI didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”\\n\\nBurke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.\\n\\n“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”\\n\\nAnother satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”\\n\\n“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”\\n\\nBurke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you *think* is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”\\n\\nI took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”\\n\\nThe man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”\\n\\nBurke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”\\n\\nI felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.\\n\\nBut below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.\\n\\n“*You.*”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”\\n\\nBurke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”\\n\\nI felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”\\n\\nThe man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  \\n\\nMy head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”\\n\\nBurke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against *you*, aren’t they, Daniel?  *You* certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  *You* didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, *did* you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”\\n\\nClosing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  \\n\\nI know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  \\n\\nTrying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”\\n\\n“*No.*”\\n\\nBurke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.\\n\\n“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”\\n\\nI could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.\\n\\nAs I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.\\n\\nThe sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.\\n\\nThis immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…\\n\\nSuddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.\\n\\nThat meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.\\n\\n[And now the man was killing him.](https://redd.it/9ndww5)',\n",

Some kind of psychologist?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man in the brown suit stared at me for several seconds before giving a slight nod.  “A fair question.  No, I’m not a doctor.  My name is Burke.  I’ve been associated with your case for quite some time now, and I’m here to help you understand.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “But the first thing you need to understand is that this will not be a pleasant experience.  I deal in harsh truths, and it is only by facing those truths that you can hope to see improvement.  Much of what I tell you will be hard to believe at first.  Things you don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to accept as true.  But if you work with me, I’ll do my…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?  What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you telling me?  Not trying to be shitty, but spit it out, man.  Then I’ll tell you if I’m buying it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, there was little question that the man grimaced for a moment before smiling again.  “Always to the point with you.  Very well.”  He leaned forward, his eyes growing harder as he continued to smile at me.  “Do you remember your little sister?  Kennedy?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, my own frown deepening.  “Yeah.  Of course I do.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you think happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt anger welling up as I shifted uncomfortably in my chair and looked around.  What was this place?  It didn’t look like a doctor’s office, or even what I’d imagine a therapist’s office would look like.  It was more like an old, creepy library some rich family always had in the movies.  And why the hell should I answer this guy’s questions?  None of this smelled right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But then again, he was right about one thing.  I didn’t know what was going on.  How I’d gotten here or where I’d been.  It’s like everything was still in my head, but I could only see parts of it, and while I didn’t trust this man, I couldn’t trust anything yet, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She…She was snatched at a grocery story when she was little.  They never found her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man smiled and gave a slight nod.  “And your father?  Something happened to him too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this, any of this.   Not having to talk about these painful, private things, nor the pleasure the man seemed to get out of watching me squirm.  “What is this about?  I want to know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke chuckled softly.  “That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.  Help you understand what’s going on.”  He raised his eyebrows.  “Your father?  Please?”  I thought I heard slight mockery in that last word, but I ignored it.  If I was going to get information from him, I needed to play along.  Anyway, fuck him.  I wasn’t afraid to talk about my past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He was killed.  Ran over by a hit-and-run driver.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another satisfied smile.  “Good.  And your friend?  Andy Murphy?  Didn’t he suffer misfortune when you were young as well?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  He died during surgery.  While we’re at it, my mother was murdered and burned too.  Is that next?  Does that complete your little line of questions designed to…what?  See if I remember the worst moments of my life?”  I stood up.  “Now I’ve answered your questions.  Answer mine.  Why am I here?  What is this place?  And what, exactly, is going the fuck on?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke looked up at me unperturbed.  “I understand this is frustrating.  It may seem mean-spirited that I’d ask you these things, but I assure you it’s a necessary evil.  Your memory and understanding of certain things tends to…fluctuate, so I need to know what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is the truth at the moment.”  I opened my mouth to argue, but he was already gesturing to the chair behind me as he continued on.  “Please Daniel.  Sit back down.  It’ll all make more sense in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took my seat reluctantly, my body tense with fear and anger as I stared at the man.  “Well?  Explain.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man nodded.  “The short, less nuanced version is this.  Your sister wasn’t abducted at a store.  By all accounts, she drowned in an inch of bathwater at your home when you were five years old.  It’s generally accepted that you were the one that was the cause of her drowning, though it was officially determined to be an accident.  Accidental or not, the pliability of your memory, even back then, meant that your parents had the option to lie to you.  Convince you that she was abducted rather than have their only remaining child feel responsible for his sister’s death.  They were successful, though whether it was truly a success by any reasonable metric remains open to debate.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke sighed as he went on.  “As for your father?  He didn’t die in a hit-and-run.  He died in your living room from a severe allergic reaction.  As you may or may not recall, he had a congenital nut allergy that was quite dangerous.  Investigation after the fact found large quantities of ground nut in milk he’d been drinking before his anaphylaxis.  The epinephrine pens he kept around the house were all in their normal places, yet he’d not tried to use them.  When they questioned the only family member home at the time, the man’s eleven year-old son, you told them you’d been in your room all afternoon, unaware that your father was dying just a few yards away.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt something crawling into my brain as the man spoke.  Snatches of conversation, images, feelings that matched what he was telling me.  Except it didn’t feel like recollection.  It felt like poison being pumped into my mind.  Poison and lies.  I felt a thrill of fear as some deep instinct within me sounded an alarm.  Taking a deep breath, I tried to imagine my mind as a green field.  There were patches I could see clearly, and parts, the things being kept from me, that were covered over in a gray fog that obscured all but the vaguest of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But below that fog was something else.  Something low, yellow and creeping that was trying to create false memories.  Change me.  Trick me.  I concentrated, picturing a strong, cleansing wind blowing across that green field, wiping out the poison and the fog, leaving only what was true and real behind.  When it was done, there was a delicate, crystalline moment of still clarity where I understood everything, and in the wake of that knowledge, a fiery rage began burning throughout my body.  I glared at the man, speaking through jaws clenched so hard I thought they might break.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You.&lt;/em&gt;”  The word came out rough and deep, laced with more venom than I’d thought I was capable of.  “It’s you, isn’t it?  You’re the one that’s been fucking with me my entire life.  The one from the house.  The one from earlier today.  Fucking with me, with Andy, and with whoever…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke gave a short laugh.  “Oh yes.  ‘Andy’.  Let’s talk about that.  You just so happen to have a roommate with the same name as your dead childhood best friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my fists balling up on my lap.  I was trying to maintain control, but between my anger and that other still trying to push its way into my mind, it was hard.  “It’s called coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man snorted.  “Coincidence.  Coincidence is what a fool calls that which he doesn’t understand.  What a liar hides behind when he’s been found out.  Is it coincidence, or another convenient delusion?  Like the thing that got you fired from the HVAC job so many years ago?  You didn’t burn that house down, right?  And there was some mysterious woman named Marisol that gave you the work order, isn’t that correct?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head was pounding now—I was either going to explode from the inside or be crushed under the weight of the thing trying to get in.  “N-No.  I mean…that’s not right…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke stood up, his voice getting louder.  “In fact, the whole world is against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t they, Daniel?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; certainly didn’t burn your mother to death in her own home, did you?  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; didn’t construct this elaborate persecution fantasy just to excuse the fact that you are a murder and a psychopath, &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you Daniel?”  He paused, taking a breath.  “I told you these are going to be hard truths.  I’m here to help, not to trick you, but you…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Closing my eyes, I focused on the field again.  Tried to ignore the pain and the pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know who I am.  And I know what this is even if I don’t know what to call it.  I’m at the sleep study.  Except I’m not, not really.  Not right now.  Because this isn’t a dream.  This is some other place.  A place where this man or whatever it is can touch me.  Can try to complete whatever it started all those years ago.  Take me over, drive me crazy, kill me, whatever it wants, it’s hounded me my entire life.  Has hurt everyone I’ve ever been close to.  Taken away almost everything that matters.  And now it wants to finish the job.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stand felt like someone had dialed up the gravity by a thousand percent.  Maybe they had.  I had the feeling the rules of this place were a lot closer to a dream.  As if to confirm this, I felt something reaching out, grasping at my arms and legs.  Opening my eyes, I looked down to see the chair I’d been sitting in flowing out like taffy, wrapping tendrils around me as it tried to pull me back down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…they would say if you hadn’t killed them?  They’d tell you that…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…aren’t well.  And if you don’t accept the truth, if you don’t let me…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burke staggered back, a crack as loud as a gunshot echoing across the room.  When he looked up again, I saw that part of his cheek was missing, cracked away like a piece of broken china.  There was no blood or bone underneath, just a small window into the utter dark that lay inside.  The thing’s eyes blazed with pain and anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve always been stubborn.  Strong.  It’s what made you such a good offering and candidate when you were young.  Now?  Now it just makes you tedious.”  It took a staggering step forward.  “And you’re right.  This isn’t a dream.  If you die here, you’re really dead.  And even then, there’s no escape from the storm.”  It smirked.  “But I know how loathe you are to trust me.  So how about I just show you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could still feel something scrabbling across the surface of my mind, but the pressure was gone now.  The chair beneath me was still squirming and flailing, but when I yanked at my arm, I pulled free easily.  The Burke-thing was almost to me, leering with an awful, broken grin, but it was moving slower too, like a clockwork beginning to wind down.  I thought about attacking it, but I was afraid.  I thought about running, but I didn’t want to turn my back on it, and I still wasn’t sure how I could escape.  So instead I backed up, keeping distance between us until I reached the far wall of the office.  It bought me a few seconds, but I still needed to find a way to make Burke stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I had the thought, I noticed the thing jerked and slowed down further.  Almost out of instinct, I had the thought again that it needed to stop.  Stop for good and forever like the dead thing it was.  It staggered again, its speed now more like watching something moving through water or quicksand.  The next moment it seemed frozen in place like a statue, but then it gave a final, lurching shudder forward and fell over, shattering on the floor into dozens of bloodless pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight of this man’s transformation into some kind of broken doll should have broken me in turn, but it didn’t.  Instead, I immediately began looking for a way out.  At first, there seemed like there was none.  The walls and windows and door all felt real enough, but none of them opened or took any kind of damage.  I spent what felt like the better part of an hour prying and hitting different potential weak points only to find that there were none.  When I finally collapsed onto the floor, sweaty and exhausted, I found myself wondering if I would die there after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately led me to thinking about my roommate Andy.  I felt more certain than ever that this was all my fault—that I’d dragged him into this nightmare and now he might be trapped like I was…or have it even worse.  I wished I could find him and at least get him out of this.  If only I…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the old library was gone.  I was in a field of what looked like blackened sunflowers beneath an orange sky.  Up the hill, the towering figure of the black house sat silent and brooding like an old dragon waiting for its next meal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That meal might be coming soon.  Because closer in the field, there was a struggle going on.  I saw the woman we’d just met, Cassie, trying to help Andy fend of his attacker.  It only took a momentary savage grin from his assailant for me to recognize it as the man in the brown suit, Burke.  Somehow another version of him, or perhaps the real him, had been here while I was trapped in the library.  Distracting me while he hunted down Andy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/9ndww5\"&gt;And now the man was killing him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. \\n\\nScrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.\\n\\nThe last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.\\n\\nWhat I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.\\n\\nBut first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.\\n\\nI was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.\\n\\nThe church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.\\n\\nAs I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.\\n\\nPhilippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nThe Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.\\n\\nI asked the old priest about this.\\n\\n“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.\"\\n\\nThe first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.\\n\\nBut one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.\\n\\nThe sheep came back eventually.\\n\\nHer mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.\\n\\nHopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.\\n\\nMonths went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.\\n\\nThe bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.\\n\\nThe townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.\\n\\nI had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:\\n\\n“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”\\n\\nTime went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.\\n\\nWhat struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.\\n\\nA bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.\\n\\nEven the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.\\n\\nBut now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.\\n\\nLouis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.\\n\\nThe first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.\\n\\nOn the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.\\n\\nOn the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.\\n\\nIt was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.\\n\\nA dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.\\n\\nAt first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.\\n\\nThe Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.\\n\\nAnyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight. I knew that boy, he was always adventurous, and in his head was a sharp mind that tried endlessly to decipher the mysteries of the world. We sat him down and tried to make him describe what he had seen. His speech was incoherent, at times nearly unintelligible, but in the end, we had a somewhat clear picture of what had happened.\\n\\nIt was at dawn – the Beast never attacked in broad daylight. He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving. He looked at it more closely and made a step forward. The thought of the Beast came to his mind, but at this point, it was curiosity that drove him.\\n\\nSomething emerged from behind the bush. That something definitely did not look like a fox or a rabbit, it was much, much larger. The boy understood immediately what he was facing. He did not dare to give it a second look and ran for his life. The Beast started to chase him. He could hear its thundering footsteps getting closer: without a doubt, it was faster than him. He didn’t want to look backwards. The boy screamed at the top of his lungs, but the sound of his terror got lost to the morning mist. The Beast remained silent. No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.\\n\\nEvery fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.\\n\\nThe grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.\\n\\nAt this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing. It was the last thing the state wanted at this moment, and the King sent a brigade of two hundred men to patrol and kill the Beast. It was led by Jean Chastel, a vain aristocrat who was well known in all the country as an unparalleled hunter, using his crossbow with deadly precision. The villagers knew very well this brigade amounted to a military occupation to prevent a rebellion, but they had no say in this.\\n\\nThe soldiers got to work, looking through every scrap inch of the area, mapping down of the Beast appearances, interrogating those who could catch a glimpse of it. They were taking this very seriously and, I must admit, they were doing very good work.\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, one patrol, led by Jean himself, came back cheering. The idiot had a big pretentious smile on his face, and a huge bag hanging from his saddle.\\n\\n*“Grand succès !”* He shouted as he paraded in the streets. They had killed the Beast; he had shot his bolt right into its left eye. As the patrol came to a stop, in the village square, he opened the bag for everyone to see.\\n\\nIt was not a wolf, but it looked quite similar. It could easily be mistaken for one in the dark. It was more muscular, with long sharp teeth, his brown fur had black stripes, and it had some sort of bulge on his neck. No one had ever seen such animal before, and the townsfolks were looking at each other in disbelief at this uncanny sight.\\n\\nI learned afterwards such animal was called a hyena, and that this one had escaped from a fair held a few months prior in Clermont, not very far away from here.\\n\\nA few things were quite off though. It did not really match the captain’s depiction, except for the long limbs. Most of all, it did not have any scar that would have been left by the bullet he shot. I shrugged those thoughts off. Surely the captain couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, and there was no way to know for sure his bullet had hit – that would also explain the Beast running away so easily. I left the place reassured and went back to my church.\\n\\nI was praying in the presbytery later that day. It was already dark outside, but the moon shone brightly. Its beams pierced through the stained-glass windows, attiring themselves with the faded colours of the scenes represented. The candle I had lit was slowly burning away.\\n\\nI thought again of that hunter. It could not be that simple. He got a lucky shot and that was it? Had all the horror and death come to an end? Months of terror, swept away? Perhaps I should just be grateful all of this was over, I told myself.\\n\\nI was distracted again by the sound of what sounded like footsteps approaching the porch.\\n\\nNow that was unusual, as it was quite late already. The villagers were wise enough not to wander in the dark, unless for a good reason. And the footsteps were slow and heavy, as if the strange visitor did not care about being heard from a distance. I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.\\n\\nAnd yet the door opened. And there it was.\\n\\nIn the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.\\n\\nThe silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... \\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.\\n\\nA voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Homo homini lupus.* Man is a wolf to man.',\n",

For the sake of our own sanity, we would rather believe lies. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scrambling through old papers in the attic, I happened to find timeworn notes, older than anything else in the box. I examined them out of curiosity. I had nothing better to do anyways. The beginning was the diary of a pastor presiding in southern France. It was of historical interest, of course, but nothing was out of the ordinary. I flipped through them, trying to find a clue about the date of writing. Here it was: 1758, even older than what I was expecting. I stared in awe, wondering how they had not turned to dust already. They were signed with my own last name. An ancestor, then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last pages had been torn away. As if to replace them was a loose sheet of paper filled with nervous writings slid at the end of the notebook. It was titled “Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”. I sat down in excitement and read.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I found I did not expect. It left me not only shaken, but utterly disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some context. Everybody here in France know of the Beast of the Gévaudan. In the XVIIIth century, it rampaged through southern France, killing countless men, women and children, until it met its own demise. It is, without a doubt, the most infamous of the many feral beasts that plagued those times. The thing is, to this day, no one knew what this beast really was. The testimonies of witnesses contradicted one another, and its corpse was lost, leaving generations to wonder about its true nature. But the mystery is no more: thanks to these notes, I now know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why I stopped preaching God’s Word”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sent by my hierarchy to officiate in this little town, more of a village really, named Marvejol. Candid as I was, I felt eager to begin my service towards God and spread His Light. Had I known what would happen there… Now my faith has left me entirely. What I am about to write differs from the official string of events. To those who will read this, I share with you my secret.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be sent here. I was told the people living in these wooden hills were welcoming, and indeed they were. I thought I could brighten the lives of this small community. And truly, I tried. I think I would have been truly happy, I would have remembered these months as the best of my life, if it weren’t for the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The church I would officiate in was a humble stone building in the middle of the village. My first thought was that it looked calm, unusually calm, even for a church. But it was in a good way. A feeling of inner peace showered me as I walked in, guided by the priest I was succeeding to. The simplicity of the architecture, the altar lightened up by the sun through the windows, it really was pristine. Divine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I began to wander around, I had the idea to look at the register of births and deaths. First contact with my parish, I guess. Pages and pages were filled by names, followed by a date, and, for the deceased, by the cause of death. Out of curiosity, I was drawn to the pages. I noticed, at the corner of my eye, the old priest looking uneasy. I shrugged it off and kept reading. It felt odd having the lives and deaths of a whole village condensed in a single book, summed up with this handwriting that grew more and more uncertain as the years passed by. I was about to close the book when, on the last page, one line caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Philippe Chauvet. Born 10th November 1743. Died 17th March 1764. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast? What beast? Surely enough there had been folks killed by wolves or some other wild animals in the register. When it was the case, the animal was always named. Now this was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old priest about this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, a sad one. That evening, Philippe went out in the hills setting his snares. He didn’t come home this night, nor the next day. They went looking for him, and discovered his body by a tree, next to one of his traps. There was large cuts all over his body, as if a very large animal had attacked him. Weirdly enough, such animal barely ate him. A tragedy indeed. Of course, that is enough to frighten the villagers, you see. They are not a subtle kind. They started talking about a feral beast in these woods that had killed Philippe. If you want my opinion, it is nothing but a big wolf, maybe a bear. But they stubbornly insisted it wasn’t and wanted me to carve down the fruit of their folly in this register. So, I did. You will see for yourself, they are very kind, but difficult to reason with when afraid. That is your job now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days went by with nothing coming out of the ordinary. I tried to get to know the villagers. They were charming indeed, and they helped me feel at home. Life was simple in these hills, far away from everything, far away from the vicissitudes distinctive of urban life. Here, people were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But one week after my arrival, another villager died. A little girl. Nobody was smiling anymore. She had been sent out by her mother the evening before, at dusk, to find a stranded sheep. Her bloodied corpse was found in a ditch, with claw marks all over her, headless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sheep came back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her mother went to the church drenched in her own tears, on the brink of madness, tearing her hair apart. I did my best to calm her down, pointlessly. Nothing can ease the pain of losing one’s own blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, she did not cry for long. Two weeks later, the Beast went for her next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by. The Beast was still hungry. It wandered around the country, from the hills to the barren plateau, killing a human at least every fortnight, sometimes decimating a herd instead. Its victims were all utterly butchered, but never eaten, as if the Beast was feeding off the very act of killing, the very sight of blood, and did not need anything more.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bloodshed had started to take a heavy toll on the villagers’ morale. People grew fearful, paranoid even, wondering if they were next, eyeing the bleak woods dreadfully. No one would venture in the dark anymore. A clear line had been drawn between the village, where the Beast would never go, and the forest, where savagery patiently lurks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The townsfolks were turning to me, if not for help, then for relief. I reassured them individually, telling them that God was on our side, that our ordeal will soon be over. It was not enough. I felt like it was my duty to give them hope and to bring some light, divine or not, on this small town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the idea to gather them all in my church. I chose my words carefully:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are afraid, and I understand. But do not despair. Word has gotten out, our affliction is known beyond our hills. The slaughter shall not continue for long. Keep praying, as God is always listening. His Light is within us all, and He has not forgotten us. The day will come for this demon to be caught, and it will pay with its own blood for all it has spilled. You are a strong folk. You’ve endured bloodshed in the past, and yet you’ve stayed proud. Pray for yourselves, and do not lose hope.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time went on, and the killing only got worse. The Beast was hungry for blood. At first, it killed someone every fortnight or so, but then, it was once a week. Then, one week, it killed three different people. It had gained a taste of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What struck the villagers the most was the brutality of the Beast. Such behaviour was at odds with what should be expected from wild animals. They only killed for survival. They had no reason for such a display of cruelty. Maybe that Beast was insane, maybe it was rabid, they said. People kept speculating about its true nature. Indeed, no one among the living could tell what the Beast looked like. All those who had met its path had also met their own demise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bounty was put on its head, posters were put in every nearby village or town. Soon enough, the news spread of a feral Beast, the deadliest France had ever seen, that was spreading terror in the Gévaudan. It made it in the newspaper of the larger cities nearby, Clermont, Lyon, and made it to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the King heard of it. At first, he decided to ignore it. He had good reasons to, the relationship between His Majesty, a catholic figure, and the Protestants that inhabited the Gévaudan had always been tense. A few decades earlier, it had led to a massacre. Royal troops were sent in to annihilate those who stood up against the almighty catholic church. As the riders went away, the hooves of their horses left behind a trail of blood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But now the news had spread, in all of France and beyond, and he had to act, his reputation was at stake. He mandated some soldiers to help us find and kill the Beast. When the villagers heard this, they were far from relieved. Many had lost their father, their mother, their uncle the last time the King’s soldiers were here. Normally, they would have never accepted their return. They were so desperate they reluctantly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis XV sent a squad of twelve riders to the Gévaudan, which would be stationed in Marvejol. Pompous pricks, that’s what they were. All in white and blue, leaving the colour red for the blood they had shed. But any kind of help would be welcomed. They started patrolling the morning after their arrival. In their minds, they wished to kill the Beast as soon as possible so that they could go back to their homes and leave the place. It’s not like the villagers were doing any effort to welcome them. Most did not even speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first few days were unsuccessful, and the villagers grew increasingly angry at the soldiers. They still thought of them as enemies – in their own right. As for me, I kept filling the register. Each time I opened it, I tried not to look at the previous entries. All of them were deaths. Killed by the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, the soldiers came back with grim faces. They had found the little girl’s head, few leagues away from where her corpse had been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, however, they were livid as they passed through the village gates. Even the horses were shaking. They had encountered the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was twilight, and the last sunrays pierced through the trees, and faded away. The soldiers had spent the day scouting, as they had since their arrival. They were going back to the village when the captain caught something out of the corner of his eye, at the edge of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A dark shape, barely moving. It was large, very large according to his words, much bigger than a wolf, the size of a bear. But it didn’t really look like a bear. The captain couldn’t see clearly in the dimming sunlight, but he could distinguish some features. The Beast was gaunt, it had long slender limbs. Its head was unnaturally large.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the captain was paralyzed, his gaze locked onto the creature. Overcoming the quivering of his hands, he loaded his musket, took aim and fired. The bullet hit the Beast, the men were sure of it, but it did not even flinch. It turned towards the captain, looking straight into his soul with his dead eyes. It kept silent. For a moment, it was only the two of them, a few acres apart, watching each other, waiting for a reaction. Then, slowly, the Beast turned its back to the squad, and sank into the woods, welcoming the darkness as a protective shroud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Beast was never to be seen again by these men. People got word of the failure, and what was left of faith and trust towards the King shrank even more. Less and less people were coming to the church. Their faith diminished as their superstitions flourished. Some kept saying the Beast was sent by the Devil himself, that it was invincible to human weapons, that it would only stop when all were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks later, another sighting happened. A young shepherd had somehow survived a direct encounter. When he was brought to me by his parents, I immediately felt pity for him. Thanks to God, he was unharmed, but it was clear his mind was scarred. His eyes darted everywhere restlessly, his hands kept twisting in odd ways. It was not a pleasant sight.

He was coming back from the riverside, where he had been bathing. In truth, he was most likely coming back from a night secretly spent with the neighbour’s daughter. He had nearly reached his house when he heard rustling behind him. He did not pay attention at first. It must be some fox or some rabbit, he told himself. As it became louder, he turned around. At first, he could not see anything, as the night still engulfed his surroundings. But then, he saw some movement in the corner of his eye. A bush was moving.

No bloodcurdling howl, no threatening growl. It was not even panting. Hopefully he was close to his house – had he been just a few feet further, the Beast would have caught up on him. He jumped over the low wall, reached the door, locked himself in. He was safe. His parents were there, still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every fibre of his being quivering, he finally took a glance back, through the living room window. The Beast had stopped in front of the wall. It could have hopped over it as well, but apparently, it did not want to. The wall was hiding most of his body, but the boy could see its head protruding, its face turned to him. It was watching him, completely still. He accounted that it resembled a wolf, except the head was the size of a donkey’s. His fur was dark. The most troubling aspect was its eyes. Not only were they completely black, they were also completely still, like two obsidian stones. The boy’s father made the wild guess that the Beast was blind, finding its way through scents and sounds only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The grim encounter broke something in the boy’s soul. He would never be the same. The neighbours’ daughter stopped loving him eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear a rebellion was brewing.

I pricked up my ears, intrigued by the pace. In a split second, I contemplated the fearful thought that it might be the Beast. I dismissed the idea, reassured by the idea that even if that was the case, there was no way it could open the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet the door opened. And there it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the door frame I saw its silhouette, standing still, facing me, its grotesquely large head tipping over to its left. The low moon cast a long shadow on the floor, stretching along the nave, reaching to me. Petrified, my eyes were locked on the door frame. Its own eyes, I could hardly distinguish, but I felt their emptiness. They appeared entirely black, completely still, as if the creature was not even seeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The silhouette became clearer. There was something deeply wrong with it. It was very tall, and its limbs were abnormally long, as the captain had reported. And again, it was standing on its back legs, a posture a dog or a wolf could adopt, but could not keep for long. It almost looked like a... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, it all made sense to me. All the needless violence and brutality. The targets chosen, mostly women or children. It was obvious, though inconceivable. There was only one creature who would resort to such means.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice I was sure I had heard before said : “You are far from the truth. God’s Light is not shared among us all. He has forgotten me.” Just as he ended his sentence, as if to further stress his statement, he took off his canine mask, pulled out a knife and slit his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo homini lupus.&lt;/em&gt; Man is a wolf to man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '\\n\\n________\\n\\nThe world died in 1908. \\n\\nThat’s how it felt when the explosion ripped across the sky. I remember watching the glow pass over my village and believing it to be a bad omen. \\nIt was actually far worse. \\n\\nMy father, a fisherman of our people; went toward the glow as it got closer to the earth curious as to what this sign from above might be. \\n\\nWe should never have left the village. We should have taken shelter like the older ones told us to. Instead, I saw my father die that morning as the trees fell like paper and flattened over 80 acres of land. The fire was so grand that it burned my eyes and I had to fall to the ground just not to go blind. \\n\\nI remember at the moment of impact that I flew back a few metres. Like a doll being tossed by a toddler. The ringing in my ears was so profound I was sure that I had gone deaf. Then when I caught sight of my surroundings again I felt like I was in unfamiliar territory. The forest was suddenly a wasteland. The landscape, dark and scorched by this event. \\n\\nAs we got closer to the impact site, the area smelled of sulphur and iron. I could even taste the air, like someone had smushed copper into my mouth. \\n\\nSuddenly the ground fell out from under me and we were amid a massive crater. A ring of felled trees surrounded us for miles on all sides. The hole in the ground was like looking into a black hole, a dangerous and deadly swath of chemicals and smoke bubbling from the surface.\\n\\nMy father told me to stay behind as he and a few of the men from the village went closer to investigate. It was so hot I had to tear my shirt from my body, sweating anxiously as I watched them go into the tunnel. \\n\\nI waited an hour. Then two. \\n\\nThey never came out until the next. I sat on the embankment that entire time, trying to figure out what to do and how to cope with the loss of my father when at last they returned from the chasm. \\n\\nBut these men were not the same ones I had seen going in. Something has mutated their faces, rendering their eyes and mouth distorted and elongated. As though their features were melting off. When I saw my father I screamed. His mouth has morphed into a vat of writhing tentacles and and his eyes had multipled to cover all of his forehead. His hair was disheveled and covering his scarred back as he reached out to me with a scaly arm and begged me to find his handgun. He was hardly understandable as the mutation took him by force. \\n\\nI ran toward the backpack he had dropped near the edge of the crater and grabbed his weapon, aiming the pistol at his tormented face. I emptied the bullets into his body. But he did not die. I don’t even know if he could. \\n\\nInstead I ran, I pushed toward home and hid; desperate to forget the nightmares I had witnessed. \\n\\nThe next day, the village tried to form a search party to find them but I kept to myself. They never found a trace of them, and over the years that followed I was branded a traitor even by my own mother. \\n\\n10 years after the event, I heard the name of my village cited in an American newspaper. I had tried my best to forget the incident and move on with my life but this article brought new interest in our remote life. \\n\\nSuddenly scientists and explorers were scouring the flattened countryside, searching for any traces of the meteorite. They claimed they were trying to gather minerals, but the way they hunted told a different story. They were tracking the living. \\n\\nMy mother warned me not to follow the expedition, she said after the fall that the land was now cursed. The many illnesses we had dealt with in the past decade were evidence enough of that. Our crops were dying, our women unable to give birth. Some even went so far as to claim that I was the reason for this blight. \\n\\n“Had you not abandoned your father this would never have happened!” some said. I detested the offensive remarks but I knew I couldn’t go against them. It would be like talking to a brick wall. \\n\\nInstead I resolved to prove that I was only a victim in this grand tragedy.\\n\\nBecoming a part of the excursion was easy. They let anyone join without question, all men were so eager for answers about the crash that they felt more hands would make the work go faster. \\n\\nTreading into the forest and seeing the death and destruction still be so pervasive after all these years was disturbing enough, but then watching as these men used different tools to dig up the elements as though it were merely a treasure trove was equally frustrating. \\n\\nSome of the men dared to go farther, pushing past the dead trees to find what they believed to be signs of life. I followed them, curious to see if maybe despite the blight on this land hope could survive. \\n\\nInstead we found more nightmares. We traveled toward the north, near the mountains that ran by the lake. Many eyewitnesses had talked to the academy before this about what they saw. But for me they gave different versions of the same stories. They knew who I was, who my father had been. They spoke of demons that came infrequently to their ranches, taking what little cattle they had to the caves. \\n\\n“They walk like men. Lost souls from the day the world became upside down,” one told me. Others were not so friendly. Some even thought I should be the one to pay for these monstrous visits. \\n\\nThankfully one farmer gave us a place to rest over the night, apologizing for the superstitious behavior of his colleagues. \\n\\n“They only know what they have been taught,” he explained. But his kindness did not last long. That same night creatures attacked his ranch and we were jolted awake to see what it might be. I ran to find a good source of light and shone it toward the assailants. Only to find my horror become true when I realized the monsters were in fact the mutated men I had abandoned years ago. I recognized the bullet holes in my dismembered father’s face. \\n\\nThe farmer raised his shovel and slammed it against the mutated beast, causing the creature to shriek and wave its claws madly. \\n\\nAnd when the light hit, they ran toward the darkness and the farmers chased them with pitchforks and torches; angry that we had brought more unrest to their lands. Our stay shortened, the scientists chose to track the creatures. And I followed, desperate to see what had become of my father and the others. \\n\\nThanks to the wound given by the farmer, the trail was easy to follow. The way the tracks led to the mountains told a story. But not one of predators. \\n\\nWhen we made it to the mountainside I saw the reality. Entrails and stolen goods were scattered like scat about the cove and the entire party of mutated men from my village were huddled near a fire, fighting one another for warmth. \\nThese were not the terror of the unknown but unfortunate men and women that had been distorted and disconnected from society. \\n\\nMy hunting party didn’t see it that way though. Instead the scientists began to chatter amongst themselves about how they could sell the beasts to circus and become millionaires. It made my blood boil, and in a rage I struck. \\n\\nSome of the scientists fought back, but I was too strong. The heat of the moment was past and I realized I had killed them all. \\n\\nMy father’s pained and misshapen face looked at me and we both realized I couldn’t return to civilization now. Not as a murderer. \\n\\nSo instead I made those men a promise. \\n\\n“I will protect you,” I told them, offering them the corpses as food. The monsters were grateful and after the meat was torn from the scientist’s body, they tossed the rest into a large hole and gestured for me to follow into the mountain. \\n\\nIn such a remote wilderness, over the years we have found it easy to stay hidden. I watched as scientists came and left trying to study the after effects of the crater. I realized also I had been given some of these as a result of simply being close to my father and the others. They have become less and less human over the years, unable to die and tormented by their ghastly appearance and their mental deterioration. \\n\\nI have tried to help them as best as I can, moving them to stay hidden and hunting food here in the Siberian waste. But we will never again be a part of the world that we once knew. I died that day when the sky split. I’ve lived as a ghost ever since. \\n\\nI tell all of this knowing now that I likely will be losing touch of my own sensibilities soon, the effects of the meteorite finally taking its full toll on me. And then living as a monster, likely for the rest of eternity. \\n\\nOnce my own mind is gone, nothing will prevents these creatures from venturing beyond isolation. From finding life that can be used to hunt and to kill and to infect others. \\n\\nAll I can say is that we are sorry, we cannot control this curse that has been with us all these years. If you do encounter us, my only advice would be to run. \\n\\n[Run and hide](https://youtu.be/mWVPG8czpI4)\\n\\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)',\n",

Tens of thousands of people remain missing for over a year; those reports are then called ‘cold cases’. \\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion or reasoning when it comes to explaining these disappearances. Ranging from government conspiracy theories to simple acts of Mother Nature, individuals find their own ways to cope with the unknown. \\n\\nWhen it comes to my opinion, I am just as stumped as everyone else. There are, however, cases that I know have been manipulated or brushed past in order to preserve human sanity. \\n\\nMy eyes drifted over the missing persons fliers that laid across the living room table. All of them had one particular common trait: they were cold cases, or missing persons cases that had no reasonable explanation behind them.\\n\\nOnly I knew better. \\n\\nAs I drowned out the ensuing conversation around me between the suit and the group, I realized that I knew the cause of some of these cold cases. All of them had something to do with the supernatural, or beings that the general population wasn’t quite convinced existed. \\n\\nMy gaze drifted to an old map that was tossed to the edge of the table. It was a map of our tri-state area, riddled with red dots. I quickly connected the fliers with the map. \\n\\nThe dots represented missing persons cases, forming a cluster right around our area; stretching upwards into two different states along the Smokey Mountain region. \\n\\nThe sheer amount of dots forming the clusters completely blew my mind. \\n\\nBut again, I knew better. \\n\\nI interrupted whatever conversation was being held around me. “This entity..” I said aloud, halting the voices immediately, “it has something to do with the amount of people that go missing along the mountainside.” I stared off into space, letting my mind catch up with my words. \\n\\nRustev nodded his head slowly, the otherworldly smile never once leaving his face. \\n\\n“You see Ryan,” he began, “these officers here had an idea of what they were going up against; only they did not know the extent. This being is held responsible for every red dot you saw on that map. It is one of the first of the Wendigos; an aloha, if you will.” He explained, taking the map from the table. \\n\\n“Sean and Shelton were told directly by their superiors not to engage this creature; essentially leading you all on a suicide mission.” He smiled, his teeth glowing in the darkness. I could feel the tension in the air. “It is far more ancient than you realize, and far more powerful than you can imagine.” He shook his head, eyes darting across the map. \\n\\nBefore I realized what my body was doing, I quickly spun around and faced Sean and Shelton; my eyes burning a raging red. \\n\\n“You’re telling me,” I growled as my body morphed, “that these assholes almost made us into a statistic?! Almost made us into another red dot on a map?!” I roared in pure anger. Sean and Shelton kept their heads down, seemingly not surprised by my reaction. \\n\\nAs I snarled in the direction of the two officers, Randy stepped in between my thrashing jaws and their bodies. \\n\\n“Calm yourself Ryan, dammit!” Randy held his hand inches from my snout. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, I was brought down from my rage induced transformation, and took a step back. Randy relaxed a bit, and looked at each of us as he spoke. \\n\\n“You can’t tell me you’ve never been in a situation where you felt helpless,” he began, shrugging his shoulders. “These boys ignorantly thought that they could take matters into their own hands. Only, they knew they couldn’t do it alone; and when their buddies were completely slaughtered by this beast, they knew they could come to you.” He shook his head solemnly. \\n\\nDouglas spoke up, for the first time during this interaction. “So..you two could’ve gotten us all killed.” He said, a look of disbelief in his eyes. “You let us go into that forest, knowing what was out there. Knowing that Ryan trusted you, also knowing that you were forbidden from pursuing the case.” A strange look of anger replaced his normal, calm demeanor. He slumped onto the couch, his head in his hands. \\n\\nSean lifted his head just enough to where we could see his glare. “We had no choice,” he seethed through his teeth, “we had our reasons.” He bowed his head once again. \\n\\nDouglas stood straight up, the same fire in his eyes I had earlier. “What. Kind. Of. Fucking. REASONS?!” He snarled. \\n\\nThis time, it was Shelton who stood and slowly shuffled over to the table. He looked over the missing persons fliers until his hand rested on one. He lifted it from the stack, showing us the picture of a beautiful little girl; maybe around the age of 6. He held it up as he spoke. “My daughter, Haley.” The room fell silent. “She is one of the red dots on that damned map.” \\n\\nWe learned that Sheltons daughter was taken from a campsite he had taken her and his wife to about a month back. He had seen the monster appear out of the darkness, and snatch her from the birthday gathering they were having for her 7th birthday. My heart sank as he explained the details. \\n\\n“My wife and I,” he said, hands shaking as he held the photo of the smiling little girl, “we need an answer, a body, a piece of clothing, ANYTHING. We need to know what happened to our little girl.” \\n\\nThe rest of that night was spent looking over the fliers and placing them with the dots on the map. Rustev sat in the corner watching, that same terrifying grin on his face. My grandfather noticed the tension that his nonchalant demeanor was building in the room. \\n\\n“Rustev, this is my home,” he began as he stood, eyes locked on the suit’s dead eyes. “I believe it is time that I asked you to leave, so we can gather our thoughts.” Randy stood from the couch, fists clenched, as he moved into position behind my grandfather. \\n\\nRustev let out an otherworldly giggle, as he shrugged his shoulders. “As you wish, sir.” He headed for the door. Stopping and turning his head towards us, he added, “Do not try to be a hero, fellas.” That insane grin still plastered across his face. “If I have to come back here, I won’t be alone.” \\n\\nWith that said, he seemed to vanish out of sight. We all looked at each other, our expressions all showed similar thoughts. \\n\\nShelton and Sean went to their vehicles some time later, after profusely expressing their apologies. We all followed them outside onto the porch into the darkness, as we solemnly said our goodbyes. \\n\\nBefore driving off, Sean rolled his window down and motioned Douglas and I over. “We will be seeing you boys. Soon.” With that, they drove out of the driveway and we watched as their lights disappeared into the darkness of the road. \\n\\nDouglas and I turned, walking back to join Randy and my grandfather on the porch. As soon as we reached the top step, what we heard sent a lightning bolt down my spine. \\n\\nA loud, demonic, guttural roar erupted from the forest behind my grandfather’s cabin.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.\\n\\nI’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.\\n\\nShe hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence. Her eyes meet mine and I see my chance. I opened my arms wide and she fell into them, allowing me to wrap her up in a tight embrace.\\n\\nI immediately felt the warm of her body pressed against mine. I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. \\n\\nI continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. \\n\\nOh God, but I love hugs.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love hugs. They are, without question, the best. To keep things clear, I mean real hugs, a full embrace without hesitation or restraint. There is something special about that kind of closeness, the warmth, and the feeling of trust that just can’t be beat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll give an example so you can really understand what I mean. Just tonight I had a hug that was truly glorious. It was nearly midnight, and I was dropping a date off at their house. The evening had been wonderful, a simple, chilled out hangout at the local coffee shop. Pleasant conversation, a few jokes, and just enough dabbling in the deeper topics to plant those seedling feelings of trust and companionship. The simple kind of date that seem to only happen in the movies. All to soon the evening was drawing to a close and even if this was only our first date, I could see she wasn’t quite ready for it end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She hesitated, getting out of the car and then in a soft, shy voice asked if I would like to come inside. I smile warmly, no hints lustful intent, and agree. Once inside we continued our talking without missing a beat. Conversation flowing just as naturally as if we had known each other for years. Five minutes turned to thirty minutes and as the night wore on we crept closer and closer to each other. Slowly the talk faded and for a brief moment we considered each other in silence. Her eyes meet mine and I see my chance. I opened my arms wide and she fell into them, allowing me to wrap her up in a tight embrace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately felt the warm of her body pressed against mine. I squeezed her in tighter and she returned the favor. God, but isn’t that just the most wondrous thing to feel. The total commitment, the soft thump of her heart against my chest. It takes discipline to resist rushing the moment, to take it all in to fast. But wait I did, savoring the intimacy of that initial moment. Then I brought her in closer, feeling her begin to squirm in my arms. The frantic movement adding additional friction and life to the moment. Still I squeezed, slowly and surely, feeling the bones warp and crack. She begins to protest, but her voice is silenced as the air is pushed from her lungs. I cooed soothingly as I continued to constrict, her arms flailing, attempting to break my grip until at last there was a loud snap and she went entirely limp, her head falling to rest on my shoulder. I leaned my head against it. Enjoying the feeling of her hair upon my cheek. This sublime moment nearly brings me to tears. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to tighten the my embrace and at last the skin could no longer bear the pressure. It burst open, the hot red fountains washed over my entire form and at last the warm reached a crescendo. I gasped, relishing the heat as she bathed and soaks me. I don’t know how long this lasted before eventually the warmth faded, and her body finally went cold. Gently I rested her on the couch, patting her head before going to clean up, somber in the afterglow. I left in silence, reflecting on the whole affair, smiling at the simple joy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh God, but I love hugs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Simms**\\n\\n**Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt**\\n\\n**Case status: OPEN**\\n\\n\\\\-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM\\n\\nI’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.\\n\\n5:46 PM\\n\\nAfter  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.\\n\\n7:45 PM\\n\\nThe  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.\\n\\n8:34 PM\\n\\nThe  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.\\n\\n8:57 PM\\n\\nAll festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.\\n\\n9:42 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.**\\n\\n9:49 PM\\n\\nI’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?\\n\\n10:12 PM\\n\\nOK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?\\n\\n10:21 PM\\n\\nWalked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.\\n\\n10:24 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n10:27 PM\\n\\nI  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.\\n\\n11:14 PM\\n\\nI  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.\\n\\n11:16 PM\\n\\nIncident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.\\n\\n11:20 PM\\n\\nI  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.\\n\\n11:29 PM\\n\\nI’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.\\n\\n11:36 PM\\n\\nA  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.\\n\\n11:45 PM\\n\\nI’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--**\\n\\n11:52 PM\\n\\nI’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.\\n\\n11:54 PM\\n\\nIncident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.\\n\\n11:59 PM\\n\\nSuccess!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but\\n\\n3/8/2020 12:01 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.\\n\\n12:09 AM\\n\\nPrevious  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—**\\n\\n12:29 AM\\n\\nIn  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.\\n\\n12:38 AM\\n\\nIncident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.\\n\\n12:42 AM\\n\\nCorridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?\\n\\n12:54 AM\\n\\nIncident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.\\n\\n1:01 AM\\n\\nThe  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.\\n\\n1:08 AM\\n\\nThe screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.\\n\\n1:12 AM\\n\\nI’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.\\n\\n1:15 AM\\n\\nThe  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.\\n\\n1:18 AM\\n\\nNo  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—**\\n\\n1:24 PM\\n\\nIt  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.\\n\\n1:27 AM\\n\\nThe black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—**\\n\\nThe  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…\\n\\nHe’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.\\n\\n**--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—**\\n\\nDarkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.\\n\\nWhy?  Just end this.\\n\\n**--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—**\\n\\nSomewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.\\n\\nPain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.\\n\\nMaddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.\\n\\nChanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.\\n\\nWould  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.\\n\\nCold.  Egypt can’t be cold.\\n\\nLaying in blood.  No recourse.\\n\\nDragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.

Simms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal discovered in descending passageway near entrance to Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case status: OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Simms research log entry 3/7/2020 3:28 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  arrived at Cairo International Airport and will be making my way to the  Pyramids of Giza investigating reports from a former assistant whom,  for reasons I will be documenting later, will not be named.  On a recent  study of the Great Pyramid or “Khufu Pyramid” his team discovered what  may be a small entrance way to a grander part of the pyramid yet  undiscovered.  When his team asked to conduct additional research, they  were met with a good deal of negativity and asked to move on.  I will be  resuming this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;5:46 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After  a taxi ride that seemed like an eternity, I’ve arrived at my hotel.  I  can see the pyramids from my window.  It is certainly a sight.  I plan  on making my way to speak with my contact after the festivities on the  ground subside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;7:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  anticipation is starting to build as I watch people filter out of the  area.  If done properly and stealthily enough, the find of the  century…the millennium will be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:34 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  light show is actually better than expected as they close things down  for the day.  Makes me wish I was down with the people.  The only issue  with that is…people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All festivities seem to have ended and there are very few people.  I will now be making my way to meet with my contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:42 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   The pyramid grounds are mine to roam and explore.  My contact, which  will also go unnamed, was able to sneak me in without his co-workers  noticing.  The security guards here are notorious for giving tourists  “special tours” or show them “secret rooms” for extra money.  I was  lucky enough to find an especially greedy one who was thrilled at the  amount I offered for this opportunity to research alone at night.  I  believe it will be the first time anyone has truly done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms’ “contact” has been disabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;9:49 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  worked my way down a good portion of the descending passageway.  I  wasn’t expecting how small the passageway would be.  I almost felt like I  was going to slip several times as the ground didn’t exactly grip my  boots.  Awkwardly smooth ground to walk on and going downhill no less.   I’ve stopped and am facing a decision.  There’s somewhat of a fork in  the road.  I could either continue descending down the corridor, or  ascend towards what’s called the “Grand Gallery” which is the largest  room in the pyramid.  This is also where the supposed “entryway” was  discovered.  I have all night.  I think I’ll descend first.  The  creepiest stuff is always in the basement right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:12 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK,  I didn’t realize how long of a walk that would be.  After nearly  slipping only a half a dozen times this time, I made it to what the map  says is the “subterranean chamber”.  I really do hate the echo in this  place.  I swore I heard voices from the blackness that I came from.   Clearly ghosts, but I wish they’d stop.  Kidding of course.  That was  very scientific of me huh?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:21 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Walked  around down here for a few minutes.  I’m a little disheartened to see  how little there is to see.  It’s all just barren walls and rock.  No  mummies, no artifacts, not even a hieroglyphic.  Of course, all of those  items are now housed in the museum but as a tourist attraction you’d  think they’d give this place a little more flare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A loud rumbling was heard at 10:23 PM that seemed to course through  the entirety of the pyramid.  This rumbling was not only heard but felt.   Duration – 34 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;10:27 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now regretting my decision to descend to the chambers first.  Not  only was it a long walk down, it will be an even longer walk up.  Not to  mention tiring.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:14 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  am now back at the fork in the road.  There are wood planks here for me  to sit and rest after the uphill hike.  I will be resting and hydrating  for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:16 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   A screeching noise was heard at 11:16 PM from deep into the ascending  passageway.  I nearly choked on my water to rush grabbing my journal to  notate.  The sound was not a biological sound.  More metal on metal.  As  far as I know I’m alone though but this has peaked my interest as well  as my adrenaline.  Duration – 4 seconds. Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:20 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I  was going to make this journal entry when I reached the Grand Gallery  but…I found myself staring into the darkness of the ascending passageway  for several minutes.  I’m not one to believe in curses, ghosts, or  revived mummies but…the screeching noise has activated a sense of fear  I’ve never felt before.  I must move passed my personal emotions for the  good of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:29 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  reached the Grand Hall.  To say it is grand is, in fact, a  HUGE…overstatement.  While it’s clearly bigger than the corridors to get  here, it’s still underwhelming.  Before I investigate the mysterious  hidden passageway, I think I’ll sneak a quick look in the King’s Chamber  where the pharaoh was found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:36 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A  sarcophagus…that’s all that was in the King’s Chamber.  Again, no  markings, no items of grandeur.  When I get home, I’m going to have to  phone those documentary makers and----------Incident:  In the middle of  writing this entry I heard a sort of, chanting, coming from the Grand  Hall which I came from.  It was not a chanting that I’ve heard before  among the many cultures I’ve encountered or have seen on TV.  It was  faint but audible.  That feeling of fear has washed over me again.  I  will regain my bearings and move to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:45 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  re-entered the Grand Hall.  I have also located the supposed entryway  my associate reported to me.  It was exactly where he said it was.  It’s  quite a bit smaller than reported.  I see why it was missed for all  these decades.  It’s hard to tell but peering my flashlight through, it  does seem to go on a ways.  Saying it’s an “entryway” though is fairly  inaccurate, at least for a person.  I will document with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry – Memory Card retrieved from Nikon model D810.   Included 7 still photos of “entryway”.  Located in file C for Case  #40157J--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:52 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve  spent the last few minutes trying to figure out a way to maneuver  myself through.  I’m about 23 cheeseburgers too large.  I might end up  hurting myself getting through but I’m determined.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:54 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:  The loud rumbling returned at 11:53 PM.  Duration – 14 seconds.  Unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;11:59 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Success!   I’ve made it through!  I can barely contain my excitement to write  this.  My left arm was almost twisted 360 degrees but I made it.   Although, as I’m writing, my excitement is dwindling as I realize I’m in  a small, dark room, maybe 5x5.  There are no other hallways or tunnels.   I suppose it’s a new find that has never been documented but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3/8/2020 12:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I almost have no words.  My last entry was cut short due to making  sure this was a separate one…and noted as more important.  In writing  previous entry, I leaned against a wall and, in something I’ve only seen  in movies, the wall opened up and I fell to the floor in a completely  separate room.  As I looked back, the “door” closed back up by itself.   The door made entirely of stone, seemed to move like a mechanical door.   I have yet to explore.  The hallway seems far more vast and larger than  the explored areas of the pyramid.  Almost as if, THIS was the main  area.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:09 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Previous  entry is incorrect.  The area I was in was the hallway TO the main  area.  I am almost at a loss of words.  What I have discovered  is…extraordinary.  I can only describe it as…an arena.  Perhaps a stage.   Cascading stone seats in a circled around a flat stage area.  In the  middle of the stage is a large stone table.  Could this be a sacrificial  area?  Mummification spot perhaps?  Although, why all the seats?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division Entry—29 photos of “arena” retrieved from memory card in file C—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:29 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In  researching my new find, I almost forgot to make an entry.  I am now  convinced this is a public sacrificial chamber.  The arena spiders off  into 6 corridors.  I will be investigating each one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:38 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   The screeching sound returned.  Duration 47 seconds.  Unexplained.  It  was much louder this time.  It seemed to come from all directions as I  began walking down what I have dubbed “corridor A”.  It was far more  intense than the previous incident.  This may sound strange but the  screech sounded…angry.  Almost as if it was unhappy with my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:42 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corridor  A seems to branch off into other corridors and rooms.  Most rooms are  empty but the 3rd room on the right was concerning.  5 feet in, I nearly  fell into a seemingly endless drop.  What could this drop be for?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;12:54 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Incident:   I’m…I don’t know what to say.  I will try to put this into words.   A…shadow…a silhouette, gave chase.  As a scientist, I cannot report  seeing a ghost, I just can’t.  There may be people living in the  pyramid.  Obviously not ancient Egyptians but, modern day people that  secretly live here.  I was able to elude the “form”.  I call it a  silhouette because, it had no features.  Just a black human form.   Large, maybe 7 feet tall.  Broad physique.  No eyes, no mouth.  I saw it  down the hall and it gave chase.  No audible footsteps now that I’m  recollecting.  I ran around several corners and through many corridors.   I am now lost and deep in the maze that I’ve gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling returned.  I’m too scared out of my mind to report lengths of  time and how it’s unexplained.  I’ve tucked myself in a corner and am  building the courage to leave.  I need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:08 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The screeching.  It returned.  Still mad.  Mad at me?  I was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:12 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m  finding my journal entries to be soothing.  Recollecting what’s going  on is somehow making me feel better.  Almost as if, it’s going to be  seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  figure…it walked passed me.  No noise.  I could tell it was angry.  It  walked with a purpose.  Now I know I wasn’t seeing things.  I ran in the  opposite direction once it was out of view.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:18 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No  no no no no…it’s staring at me.  It’s across the hall and staring at  me.  I’m trying to write this while keeping an eye on it.  Sloppy  handwriting.  It’s been still for a good minute.  It’s real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—The above entry was illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities.—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:24 PM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It  left.  After what felt like forever of a motionless stare, it left.  It  left slowly, almost daring me to stay.  I don’t want that dare.  I want  to do what it wants.  I want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1:27 AM&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The black void.  In so many directions.  I’m surrounded.  No way out.  No hope.  No hope. No…sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Subject Steven K. Simms no longer provides timestamps—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The  rumbling…the screeching…my nemesis.  He taunts me.  I hear him now.  He  speaks.  Not with words…but he speaks.  My predator is stronger than  me.  More dominating than me.  More…evil than me.  I can’t…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s  solid!  I hit him.  I saw him around a corner.  I punched face.  Solid.   Did not react.  Did not move.  Hand broken.  Fear keeps pain away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal  Research Division entry—Blood found soaked into several pages around  this one.  DNA identified as Dr. Steven K. Simms—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Darkness.  Can it see me?  He’s darker than the darkness.  I can see him.  Hand starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why?  Just end this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—All entries onward mostly illegible.  Translated to the best of our abilities—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere  out there is my death.  My release from this life.  I’m a scientist.  I  don’t believe in an afterlife.  Will I black out into nothingness?  Is  that the afterlife?  Nothing?  That’s what I consider my nemesis.  He’s a  void in the darkness.  As if he’s…nothing.  I will soon be nothing as  well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pain…everywhere.   Nemesis charged.  Hit me.  I flew almost 10 feet.  Barely able to  write.  Stood over me.  Left.  He was amused.  He doesn’t want me to  die…yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maddening…I will kill him.  I will kill.  Kill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chanting.  I hear the chanting again.  Would be beautiful if not for this suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would  you know me if you saw me?  Would you care?  I have to write.  I have  to keep writing.  He doesn’t bother me when I’m writing.  This is my  saving grace.  This is my sanity.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cold.  Egypt can’t be cold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Laying in blood.  No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragging me.  Can still write.  Crushed ankle.  He’s so strong.  Tight grip.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m the star!  I’m the star of the show!  They love me here!  They all came out to see me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Paranormal Research Division entry—Bottom part of page crumpled and torn.

       "   'selftext': \"When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people's houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.\\n\\nThe rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.\\n\\nThe rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.\\n\\nThere was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.\\n\\nMe and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.\\n\\nI figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.\\n\\nMy smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa's basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. *If I looked through them,* I thought, *what would I see?* Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.\\n\\nThe door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.\\n\\nThe floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.\\n\\nI stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room. I figured I would stop first at the column in the middle, then I would make my way to the door which I assumed was at the wall opposite to mine. As I made my to the column, I tried to discern the source of the dim light. I could not tell whether it was coming from the open door behind me or from something else.\\n\\nWhen I reached the column, I ran my hand over it. It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of. I walked to the right side of the column and scanned the room for any sign of the next door. I could not see anything. It seemed that this was a dead-end. The uneasiness rose to the forefront of my mind. I had never encountered a dead end before. It was at that moment I decided to leave the rooms and go back upstairs. I took a few steps back and turned around and made my way back to the door-way.\\n\\nFrom the darkness behind me, someone said my name. “Chris!” they said. I shrieked loudly and flung around, frantically scanning the room for the source of the voice. Finally, I came upon a silhouette. “Chris.” It repeated. It was Antonio’s voice. “An-Antonio?” I said. “Yeah! It's me! I can't believe you are here as well, and that the rooms appear to you too!” “But....but...” I began, “ You were sleeping upstairs. How are you down here?” I was confused and frightened. As said before, I had never encountered anyone in the rooms before. I didn't think anyone else but me could experience them. The darkness of the room we were currently in certainly did not help either. 'Antonio' took a step forward. “I followed you down after seeing you come down.”\\n\\nI remember taking a step back. “No....” I said, “..how did you get down here, without me noticing?” The silhouette paused for a second, and said, rather flatly: “There is.....another entrance.” “What?” I said, “where?” The silhouette walked to the back right corner of the room and, after looking down, looked back in my direction. I could see none of its features. “Right here.” said 'Antonio', again flatly. He then bent over, grasped something, and pulled open a trap-door. “Come on. It's really cool. You will never believe where it leads.”\\n\\nAs I said, the room we were in was dark, but not pitch-black. This new room, the one beyond the trap-door before me, however, was as dark as vanta-black. It seemed to suck in the darkness around it. “I'm not going down there. Can't you see how dark it is? Are you crazy?” The figure didn't move. “Chris.... come on.” “No. I'm going upstairs. See you there.” I turned around and made my way out of the room. “Chris!” Said the now-emotionless voice. The voice was now scratchy as well as flat. I quickened my pace and reached the large room where I started, and turned back to view the hall-way. Whoever that was didn't follow me back. I ran across the large room and back to the closet door. I quickly walked through it and closed it, quietly.\\n\\nAnd that was it. As you probably expect, when I went upstairs my cousin was there, still sound asleep. When he woke up I asked him if he “had been downstairs” at all during the night. He said no, of course.\\n\\nThe rest of my experiences with the rooms was simply seeing the white-doors every now and then, but I never went back in. Eventually they stopped appearing all together. Of course, they remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I wonder if they were real, but I know they were. I had visited them too many times and had too many vivid memories of them. I think it is safe to say that whoever was in that dark room wasn't my cousin.\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, as in 5 or 6 years of age, I started to happen upon extra rooms within people&amp;#39;s houses. They of course would never appear when I had adults with me, and I would find the rooms when they were preoccupied or when it was late at night and they were sleeping. When my parents or whoever came looking for me, they would never find me until I came back from exploring the rooms. They would always remark about how I just “appeared out of nowhere” and scared the shit out of them. I would always point and laugh at them, acting as if I had just pranked them. I never did tell them about my experiences with the rooms. I just considered it to be something that was unique to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms, when they would appear, would usually appear in the basement or upstairs areas of whatever building I was in. They rarely would appear on the main floor, and when they did, they would usually appear in the back of large closets, hidden by clothing or what have you. Their appearance would be marked by a normal white door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rooms stopped appearing at about 11 and a half years old and overall, the experiences never struck me as sinister in nature. They were natural to me. Something that had been with me for years and that I would always find if I went looking. To me at the time, they were just rooms. Mysterious sure, but rooms nonetheless. They would always be empty, and would vary in size, from very large to tiny. Usually, they would take after the parent house or building they spawned from, but sometimes they would be completely different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was one experience, however, that has become more a more disturbing to me as the years have gone on. It also was one of my last experiences with the rooms, and the only time another person had been in them with me. The event started off normal. Me and my cousin, Antonio, were having a sleepover at my grandpas house on the eve of New Years in 2004. The day-time consisted of the usual shenanigans. We would play video-games, run around outside, etc. The experience which is the subject of this story begins at about 2 am on New Years day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Me and Antonio were sleeping in the living room, well, at least he was. I was staring at the dark-ceiling, not being able to fall back asleep. I remember looking at Antonio, and, seeing that he was asleep, slid my legs off the couch and stood up. I was going to go downstairs and see if the rooms would appear. I made my way to the staircase to the basement and walked down them into the darkness. When I reached the bottom door-way I flipped on the light-switch and observed the large room before me. My grandpas basement was particularly large, and was stocked with boxes, extra furniture and other things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I figured that the most likely place for the appearance of the rooms was the extra bedroom. So I made my way into the dark room and turned the lights on. I began my search. First, I looked behind the door, nothing. I then looked into the bathroom, normal as ever. I then turned my eyes to the closet. I walked over to it and flung open the door. I stepped inside and pushed the clothing aside. Jackpot. Before me stood a 4 paneled white door with a gray door-knob. With a smile on my face I grabbed the knob, twisted it and opened the door. I was met with a short hall-way that led into a room with a concrete floor, reminiscent of the basement to behind me. I let go of the door and walked through the hall-way into the room. The room was massive, as if I had just walked into a pole-barn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My smile grew even larger. I had never before encountered a room this large. The walls were white-brick, also reminiscent of my grandpa&amp;#39;s basement, and near the top they were lined with windows. A gloomy, gray light came through them, as if it was overcast outside. &lt;em&gt;If I looked through them,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;what would I see?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, there was no way I could do so. The room was entirely empty, the only thing being a door-way on the other side, leading to another room. There was no door. I eagerly made my way over to it, anxious to see what was next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door-way led not to another room, but to another hall-way. This one was very long, with no doors or windows on either side. The hall-way was rather...dark, and at the end I could barely see another plain, 4 paneled white-door with a gray door knob. I stopped, and felt, for the first time in my time exploring the rooms, uneasiness. I had never seen something like this. The rooms would always have some kind of light-source within them. Whether there were windows are fluorescent lighting, there would always be something. Here there was nothing. I pushed my uneasiness to the back of my mind, and walked into the hall-way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor was the same concrete while the walls were the the same white-brick. When I made it to the door, I stopped and examined it. It was the typical white door that I was ever familiar with. I expected that when I opened it I would come across another room, similar to the large one, at least when it came to lighting. I grabbed the knob and opened the door, which is when I learned just how wrong I was. The room was very dark. Not pitch black, but at the point where you could see the outlines of things. I saw, in the middle of the room, a column from ground to ceiling which while high up, was not as high up as the other room. The walls were not nearly as long either, resembling more the size of my grandpas basement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, door-knob it hand, mouth-agape, staring into the room. It may seem crazy, but I was not necessarily scared at the time. I felt uneasy, sure, but I figured this was just a new experience. I had never had negative experiences with the rooms before. I let go of the doorknob and, after opening the door as wide as it would go, walked into the room.

It was cold concrete, not bricks this time. I could not tell from my current position what the walls were made of.

(Part Two)\\n\\n(Part One [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))\\n\\n“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. \\n\\nOctober nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.\\n\\nAfter class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”\\n\\n“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. \\n\\n“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.\\n\\nLeo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” \\n\\nI was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. \\n\\n“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.\\n\\n“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. \\n\\nI pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!\\n\\n“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.\\n\\nI could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.\\n\\n“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.\\n\\nThey were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n\\nI slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. \\n\\nThe warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. \\n\\nBrandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. \\n\\n“Shani?” \\n\\nI choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.\\n\\nThis was not my girlfriend.\\n\\nThis was the monster that had taken her.\\n\\n——————————————————————————————————————————\\n\\nHey, everyone!

(Part Two)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Part One &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ffntkj/im_a_demon_and_my_friends_are_in_hot_water_with/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You look like a wreck,” October said as I slid into the seat next to them. That was putting it lightly. It had been three days since Rya vanished, and I was tearing myself up about it. I had to get her back, but I had no idea how to. I stayed up through the night researching, only to be met with blank screens and no results. Whatever that had taken my girlfriend knew it would make me miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;October nudged me. “Hey, Danielle just assigned a group project. You’re in a group with Leo and some other guy.” I didn’t know how much time had passed as I numbly walked over to Leo and another man. We were exchanging pleasantries when I saw the man’s—Alatar, he said his name was—bracelet. On it was a silver symbol of one circle and a crescent shape on each side. A pagan symbol. If Alatar was a witch, he might be able to help me find Rya. The best I could do was try.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After class I followed Alatar into an alleyway. He must’ve knew I needed something, because he turned around to face me, arms crossed. “Alatar, are you a witch?” I asked. He tensed slightly. I couldn’t blame him. He might’ve thought I was a witch hunter. “Depends. What are you?” He asked, lips pursed. I hesitated. Normally, I wouldn’t dare give up my biggest secret to someone I just met, but I was desperate. “I’m a demon,” I said, and Alatar relaxed. “I’m a demon, and I need your help,”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So, you need a locator spell?” I nodded. Whatever could find Rya. “Okay, I’m going to need something of the person who you want to find,” Alatar said. I took off Rya’s necklace. It helped me remember her and give me hope that she was okay. Alatar nodded and placed the necklace on top of a compass. He lit candles in a circle around it. As he began chanting the incantation, the smoke from the candles started swirling around the compass, growing thicker and thicker until it hid the compass from view. The flames grew brighter and brighter before extinguishing completely. Alatar handed me the compass. It pointed northeast. I knew where I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was opening my car door when I heard the telltale patter of fast footsteps behind me. I whirled around, my posture turning defensive. I was met with October and Leo, the former of which was holding a large hunting knife. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re going with you,” October said simply, arms crossed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, but I can’t let you. It’s way too dangerous.” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Leo spoke up, the normal quiet boy fiery and intense. “Rya’s our friend too, and if you think we’ll just sit around and her go missing, you’re wrong!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback at his outburst, but I still tried to dissuade them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dangerous. I can’t put you in harm’s way again!” I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What makes you more suited for danger than us?” October asked, hands on their hips. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pursued my lips as I tried to figure out what to say. This wasn’t like with Alatar. I couldn’t tell them. They were humans. They wouldn’t understand. But I had to tell them something!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had experience with the entity that took Rya,” I settled on, finally. A half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell that October was skeptical, but they went along with it for the sake of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ll need backup, then. We’re going, whether you want us too or not,” they said, an air of finality surrounding their statement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were too stubborn to persuade. I knew that they wouldn’t relent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the car door shut as I walked determinedly towards the warehouse. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that I felt about this whole situation. It seemed too suspicious that Rya was in a building so close and accessible to me. I think a part of me knew it was bait, but I was too desperate to turn away this chance of finding her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The warehouse itself was decrepit and rusty. A horrible place to be trapped in. One part of me hoped she would be inside so I could find her, but one part of me hoped she wouldn’t have had to suffer inside this building for the past three days. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Brandishing my flashlight, I made my way inside. The warehouse was dirty and dark, patches of long-dead vegetation springing up all around me. I heard a faint dripping in the distance. My heart froze when I heard a familiar voice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Shani?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I choked back a sob as tears of relief sprang to my eyes. Her voice was soft and weak, but it was still there. She was still there. I ran towards the voice. Rya was bound with dirty rope in the corner, black hair matted and tangled, brown skin scraped and scabbed. As gently as I could, I untied her. I wrapped my girlfriend’s fragile form in my arms, wanting to never let her go. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I cupped Rya’s face in my hands and lifted my head to look at her. But I wasn’t met with Rya’s face at all. Her amber eyes turned obsidian, brimming with malice. She wore a sharp yellow smile, red forked tongue flickering in and out of her mouth. Familiar rancid breath hit my face. That was when I knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was not my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was the monster that had taken her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;——————————————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, everyone! It’s CelestialBiromantic here! Sorry this post got taken down. Reddit took it down. Thanks for being so understanding!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My name is project #124 part two\\n\\n\\n\\nPapa asked me a strange question. I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? \\n\\nToday’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. \\n\\nJournal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...\\n\\nSo it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! \\n\\nI had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” \\n\\nI love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!\\n\\nThe strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...\\n\\nHave you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.\\n\\nThey took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.\\n\\nI didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.\\n\\nI asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” \\n\\nI told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. \\n\\nIt’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!\\n\\nWell good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.\\n\\nThey had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!\\n\\nThe strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?\\n\\nI was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? \\n\\nAs I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!\\n\\n\\nWhy wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... \\n\\nThey gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.\\n\\nPapa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! \\n\\nHe ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.\\n\\n“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?\\n\\nPapa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. \\n\\nPapa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.\\n\\n\\nHey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. \\n\\nI was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. \\n\\nI didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. \\n\\nPapa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  \\n\\nI found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!\\n\\nHis restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.\\n\\nHe didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!\\n\\nThey ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... \\n\\n“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.\\n\\nPapa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is project #124 part two&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa asked me a strange question. I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, “Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry?” I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isn’t that enough? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called “puberty” but that sounds so boring. They wonder if it’ll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Journal, you must be curious about today’s testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I don’t like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life I’m being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says it’s all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! I’ll be back in a little while...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So it turns out I’ll be doing a new test. Fire... I’m not excited for it! I’m terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that I’m being selfish for trying to get out of it! I don’t wanna be selfish! I don’t want papa to hate me... I’m a terrible Project aren’t I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa’ s yet I’m always so scared. I’m a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had to take a small break from writing... it’s been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I can’t test myself I’ll hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, “What are you doing my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! “Punishing myself for being a bad project!” I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesn’t matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! That’s so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness it’s testing time! I’ll right as soon as one back...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you haven’t you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I  was for an hour or two and lost control of  my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didn’t even know why I was crying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as “spinal fluid.” Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. It’s not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didn’t have a brain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I can’t die though. I really want to. I’m gonna ask papa if I’ll be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that can’t be filled. Oh yay! It’s almost lunch time. I’ll write back soon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didn’t seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad.  Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, “Why would you want to die, my little project?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didn’t seem too happy. I think I’ve found a new hobby though! It’s finding out how to die! I’ve tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well good day journal... I actually don’t know if it’s day time or not... I don’t know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense I’m still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didn’t kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? I’m not sure that I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldn’t struggle at all. Surprisingly they didn’t gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, “Why aren’t I gagged?” Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, “You aren’t gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt.” I started to whimper a little. Melting doesn’t sound fun at all!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does “African decent” mean? I’ll ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. “Papa! Please no more!” I screamed.... but he didn’t hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but it’s for the great or good right! Right? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I screamed and begged my tongue melted. “Aaarhg haaaa!” Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. “Don’t touch me! I want my papa! Papa!” I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. “Papa, I want my papa!” I continued to scream but papa... he wasn’t there!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why wasn’t he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts we’re working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh.  I thought that they’d let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said “The little shits screams are pissing me off!” I don’t know what I “little shit” is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. What’s that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. “Where were you papa?  Why did you leave me?” I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, “sorry champ! I had some business to attend to.” I asked him about it and he told me “A good project doesn’t need to know such things.” I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He ruffled my hair and said, “You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on.” I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didn’t work!  When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“After the test I really wanna die. I don’t really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone.” The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him what’s on his chest. “What are those squishy things on your chest?” The strange man looked... insulted?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But what’s a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently we’ve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why he’s not a “he” or a “sir” but I didn’t really listen. They soon left alone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently I’m “depressed” and showing “suicidal tendencies” which is odd. It’s pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I can’t die right? As for the depression... I don’t know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasn’t that good if I’m being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I don’t know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasn’t like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. He’s the bad man with the silver badge I think. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. “It’s ok Project... it’ll be ok.” I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I don’t think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that it’s normal to feel like that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security.  Anyways... I’m tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasn’t the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldn’t speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His restraints were also different. But then again he’s a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do “missions.” Papa said I will never do missions because I’m too... fragile which is odd sense I’ve been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff.  The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t heal.... he’s not like me. He’s a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think I’ll be having dreams about him for a long time. I don’t even know what he did to me! I didn’t understand it and I can’t understand it because papa said he doesn’t want me too!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Aren’t you grateful project!” Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasn’t been back sense and papa is upset with me. “Papa, I’m grateful and happy! I don’t need a mama or anyone! All I need is you!” After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Papa says new test are going to begin soon. I’ll be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I don’t really want to do it. The great or good doesn’t sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The bugs that came from the wall. [Part I]\\n\\nIt was only 9:00 am when it started spreading.\\n\\nThere had been subtle vibrations from the ground for the past few weeks. I thought nothing of it until it crept up to the walls. My friend Kathrine was over and she had just stolen my phone and ran off. I pinned her to the wall playfully, laughing and trying to retrieve my phone when her smile faded into concern. “Everything alright?” I asked her. We stood silently for a moment, Katherine still against the wall. “Come feel this.” She said moving out of the way. I put my hand against the wall but lept back when I felt the throbbing. I stood for a moment pondering where I had felt this before. Katherine spoke up “I think...I think it’s in the floor too.” I looked at her surprisingly as I thought I had imagined the floor vibrating. I gave a nervous laugh “It’s probably the vents or something!” We stood still again not knowing what to do or say. \\n\\nA few hours after Katherine had left I started getting curious about the vibrations again. I was at my kitchen bar which was connected to the wall so I just leaned my head over about 2 inches away from the wall, to see if I could hear anything first. The vents weren’t on, which made sense because it was a fine spring day. I then very slowly placed my hand on the wall. The vibrations were there again, but...why couldn’t I hear them before? I decided to place my ear ON the wall this time.\\n\\n I wasn’t nervous at this point because there could be a very rational explanation for why a house full of machinery and electricity was vibrating through the walls. I wasn’t nervous that is, until I heard the heartbeat.\\n\\nIt was very distinct. The bump bump...bump bump. It startled me to hear this coming from my wall. I jumped back, knocking my milk over and almost my stool. At first I thought I might’ve just imagined it but when I leaned in to listen again it was the same as before bump bump...bump bump. Confused and a little frightened I went to grab a towel for the milk. After I cleaned and gathered my thoughts I came up with an explanation that there was an animal living in my wall. I mean... the vibrations could just mean the animal was moving and since me and Katherine both felt it, there were probably just a few creatures scurrying about. \\n\\nI talked to Katherine and she recommended calling an exterminator the next day but I had plans the entire afternoon. But...it was fine right? Boy was I wrong. The one day that I was out was the one day that I shouldn’t have been. \\n\\nBy the time I got home from my long day of shopping and visiting my parents it was 10:40. I did my usual, putting groceries away, taking a shower and eating but then I noticed that something didn’t feel right. As I was sitting in bed on my phone I couldn’t help but feel that I was being stalked. Not just watched but like intense staring wherever I was. I went to the bathroom then walked back but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I texted my mom but she had apparently already gone to bed, so I instead texted Katherine. She told me that she had been in a situation like this before and all she had to do was get on a call with someone so that if there was actually someone there they wouldn’t try anything, and it worked. \\n\\nI decided to just FaceTime Katherine because we were already talking and she was a night owl like me. We talked for a few minutes just about past funny moments to make me feel better and then I realized what was wrong, well might be wrong. I hadn’t felt the vibrations when I got home. Maybe the animals had left? “Wait Katherine I think the animals are gone because-“ I looked back at the screen but Katherine’s face had gone pale. “What’s...wrong?” I asked forgetting about my situation for a second. “Don’t freak out...but there’s goo coming out of the wall.” I turned around expecting nothing but instead saw a trail of cloudy yellowish goo coming from a tiny hole in the wall. I scooted forward disgusted by the sight. It dripped down pretty slowly like slime would. “I wonder...” I said out loud. I stepped off my bed and felt the vibrations stronger than I had ever felt them. I walked over to the wall and put my hand on it. It was even stronger here and this time it FELT like a heartbeat. I put my ear up to the wall but didn’t hear anything until I thought I heard a light scratching noise from my bed. I turned and that’s when the pounding started. Louder and louder it got. I could see the wall behind my bed moving. “What’s happening?!” I could hear Katherine yell through the phone. \\n\\nIt all happened at once. The wall pushed forward and a large crack formed. Then it happened again. Then on the 3rd time it broke open. Thank goodness I was on the other side of the room because a giant chunk of the wall came crashing onto my bed, crushing my phone under it. I watched in pure horror as spiny, bony creatures came screeching out of the wall, covered in ooze, blood, and tiny bits of eggshell.',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' “We’ll put you up in a different dorm block, if that’s OK. Yes, I know room 13 is empty, but it’s not available. That is for the safety of the students. I hope you understand.”\\n\\n“Ah well, yes, apartment 8 IS unoccupied. No, it’s not that we prefer families over shared accommodation. Our true preference is that nobody ever gets into that house ever again.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, I have to insist on any of these rooms instead. Some are similar, some even better. Honestly, I’d rather you take any other room in this hotel, sir. Room 76, you just can’t have. Nobody can… should have that one.”\\n\\nHaunted house stories are plentiful and amusing. I suppose you have heard of or read a few yourself. Goodness knows I’ve encountered my fair share of wardens, real estate agents and hotel managers determined to cordon off supposedly spooked accommodation from human occupation. While I do like a good hair-raiser to read over dinner, it’s quite annoying when your preferred room is denied to you based on some fable. People die or lose their minds all over the world, in all sorts of locations. If we quarantined every single spot where a mishap occurred, we’d need a new planet quite soon.\\n\\nWhen you’re in college, you’re at the mercy of the administration’s whims and you live with what you’re given. You deal with the leaking flush in your bathroom’s toilet. You learn to sleep through your roommate inexplicably turning the lights on from 2–4 AM. However, I am now 34, and paying top dollar. When I say I need a hotel room that provides sunlight at certain hours, or a tranquil location to set up shop in, I mean it.\\n\\nBy now, I’d had it. Something needed to be done. Which is why, on my business trip to Rex City last week, room 666 at the Aloft Grand was my hotel of preference. The business? Ghostbusting. I researched Rex City’s resident spook and decided to merge my annual getaway with my determination to put the town folk at ease.\\n\\nI expressed this preference to the hotel manager. And what do you think he said? “Sir, I see you are requesting room 666. I am happy to explain in detail the myriad ‘occurrences’ in that room. But let me just say it would be in both our best interests that we put you up elsewhere.”\\n\\nThis time, I wasn’t having it. “I truly appreciate your concern, my good man. I am aware of the ‘occurrences’ you speak of. Regardless, I insist on having that room.”\\n\\n“Sir, I understand that room provides a lovely view of the ocean. We have other rooms overlooking the beach as well.”\\n\\n“Let me be even clearer. The only reason I am even in this hotel is to stay in that room.”, I said.\\n\\n“Pardon me, sir? Are you of sound mind?”\\n\\nI chuckled at his bold question. “Well, let me try to put you at ease. I am a citizen who wants to give back to the community. It will not do for the town folk to be running scared of a resident spook, and I presume it’s certainly not good for the hotel’s business.\\n\\n“Sir, I’m not sure where you’re...”\\n\\n“Let me help you turn things around.”, I interjected.\\n\\nHe sounded resigned with his response. “Very well sir. Forgive me for being so morbid, but let me remind you that you agreed to certain terms when booking this hotel, and among those is a complete waiving of liability on this hotel should any injury or death occur in this particular room. I can refund the booking amount in full if you wish to reconsider.”\\n\\n“I am aware, and I have no issues. Please give me the key and show me the way”.\\n\\nHe handed me the key, showed me the elevator, made the sign of the cross and said a little prayer. Nice gesture, even if unnecessary.\\n\\nAt this point, I did still expect something to happen\\u200a—\\u200athe elevator to auto-skip the 6th floor and force me to use the stairs, the floor to have a foul smell, the door to reveal a room that hadn’t been cleaned in years.\\n\\nWhat did happen? Nothing. The door was the same colour and type as the others on the floor. The room was perfectly normal\\u200a—\\u200aBed, bathroom, television, room service menu and fully stocked minibar. The WiFi password was on a sticky note above the intercom phone, along with the necessary contact numbers. I ordered in dinner, cracked open a Corona, connected to Netflix and started to binge The Haunting of Hill House. Nothing like a bit of banter to start an encounter with spirits, I thought.\\n\\nI ran through the entire show (10/10, I must say) and fell asleep at 11 PM. Surely now the ghouls would work their magic? Nope. A full night’s sleep, and nothing happened. What a bore. At least now I had good news to deliver! I took a shower, packed my things up, locked the room and started towards the elevator.\\n\\nExcept, I couldn’t just ignore what I saw and go to the elevator\\u200a—\\u200aevery other room on the floor was wide open.\\n\\nI stepped into room 665, curious. I found a middle-aged woman lying face down on her bed. She wasn’t breathing. I rushed to her intercom and dialed reception for help, but nobody picked up. How incompetent! 1/10 from me, the moment I had time to review. I called an ambulance and the police, and headed to check room 664. Much to my horror, another lifeless occupant! This time, a plump man around my age, on his back, eyes shut. 663, 662, 661\\u200a—\\u200athis was the scene in every room on the floor.\\n\\nI went down the elevator and ran to the reception, only to find the receptionist and hotel manager lying wide-eyed and lifeless on the common hall couches. I was numb and speechless as the cops and doctors arrived.\\n\\nEveryone in the hotel was dead. Everyone except me.\\n\\nI suppose I did manage to turn things around.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll put you up in a different dorm block, if that’s OK. Yes, I know room 13 is empty, but it’s not available. That is for the safety of the students. I hope you understand.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah well, yes, apartment 8 IS unoccupied. No, it’s not that we prefer families over shared accommodation. Our true preference is that nobody ever gets into that house ever again.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, sir, I have to insist on any of these rooms instead. Some are similar, some even better. Honestly, I’d rather you take any other room in this hotel, sir. Room 76, you just can’t have. Nobody can… should have that one.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Haunted house stories are plentiful and amusing. I suppose you have heard of or read a few yourself. Goodness knows I’ve encountered my fair share of wardens, real estate agents and hotel managers determined to cordon off supposedly spooked accommodation from human occupation. While I do like a good hair-raiser to read over dinner, it’s quite annoying when your preferred room is denied to you based on some fable. People die or lose their minds all over the world, in all sorts of locations. If we quarantined every single spot where a mishap occurred, we’d need a new planet quite soon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When you’re in college, you’re at the mercy of the administration’s whims and you live with what you’re given. You deal with the leaking flush in your bathroom’s toilet. You learn to sleep through your roommate inexplicably turning the lights on from 2–4 AM. However, I am now 34, and paying top dollar. When I say I need a hotel room that provides sunlight at certain hours, or a tranquil location to set up shop in, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By now, I’d had it. Something needed to be done. Which is why, on my business trip to Rex City last week, room 666 at the Aloft Grand was my hotel of preference. The business? Ghostbusting. I researched Rex City’s resident spook and decided to merge my annual getaway with my determination to put the town folk at ease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I expressed this preference to the hotel manager. And what do you think he said? “Sir, I see you are requesting room 666. I am happy to explain in detail the myriad ‘occurrences’ in that room. But let me just say it would be in both our best interests that we put you up elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I wasn’t having it. “I truly appreciate your concern, my good man. I am aware of the ‘occurrences’ you speak of. Regardless, I insist on having that room.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I understand that room provides a lovely view of the ocean. We have other rooms overlooking the beach as well.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let me be even clearer. The only reason I am even in this hotel is to stay in that room.”, I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Pardon me, sir? Are you of sound mind?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I chuckled at his bold question. “Well, let me try to put you at ease. I am a citizen who wants to give back to the community. It will not do for the town folk to be running scared of a resident spook, and I presume it’s certainly not good for the hotel’s business.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sir, I’m not sure where you’re...”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Let me help you turn things around.”, I interjected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sounded resigned with his response. “Very well sir. Forgive me for being so morbid, but let me remind you that you agreed to certain terms when booking this hotel, and among those is a complete waiving of liability on this hotel should any injury or death occur in this particular room. I can refund the booking amount in full if you wish to reconsider.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I am aware, and I have no issues. Please give me the key and show me the way”.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He handed me the key, showed me the elevator, made the sign of the cross and said a little prayer. Nice gesture, even if unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I did still expect something to happen\\u200a—\\u200athe elevator to auto-skip the 6th floor and force me to use the stairs, the floor to have a foul smell, the door to reveal a room that hadn’t been cleaned in years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What did happen? Nothing. The door was the same colour and type as the others on the floor. The room was perfectly normal\\u200a—\\u200aBed, bathroom, television, room service menu and fully stocked minibar. The WiFi password was on a sticky note above the intercom phone, along with the necessary contact numbers. I ordered in dinner, cracked open a Corona, connected to Netflix and started to binge The Haunting of Hill House. Nothing like a bit of banter to start an encounter with spirits, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran through the entire show (10/10, I must say) and fell asleep at 11 PM. Surely now the ghouls would work their magic? Nope. A full night’s sleep, and nothing happened. What a bore. At least now I had good news to deliver! I took a shower, packed my things up, locked the room and started towards the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I couldn’t just ignore what I saw and go to the elevator\\u200a—\\u200aevery other room on the floor was wide open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped into room 665, curious. I found a middle-aged woman lying face down on her bed. She wasn’t breathing. I rushed to her intercom and dialed reception for help, but nobody picked up. How incompetent! 1/10 from me, the moment I had time to review. I called an ambulance and the police, and headed to check room 664. Much to my horror, another lifeless occupant! This time, a plump man around my age, on his back, eyes shut. 663, 662, 661\\u200a—\\u200athis was the scene in every room on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went down the elevator and ran to the reception, only to find the receptionist and hotel manager lying wide-eyed and lifeless on the common hall couches. I was numb and speechless as the cops and doctors arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the hotel was dead. Everyone except me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I did manage to turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Test subject 5441 was to be our first success. After five thousand four hundred and forty previous subjects, we finally achieved our goal. We cured the common cold. The strain we inoculated 5441 with was a specially engineered strain of the common cold dubbed “Brutus.” Doctor McNamara named it that due to how we developed the strain. It was meant to lie dormant in the walls of blood vessels until the patient contracted a common cold, at which point the Brutus Strain would awaken and turn on the cold, overriding the virus and turning it harmless and benign. The now harmless cold would be flushed out of the body through the body’s own natural functions. We infected the virus with our own virus. Every test subject before was a failure. But on every test subject we used a different “angle of attack.” On 5441, however, it was initially overwhelmingly successful.\\n\\nWe first inoculated 5441 with the Brutus strain and waited fourteen days for the strain to incubate and prime itself. After the waiting period, we injected 5441 with the common cold. It was a fast acting strain but not particularly vicious. 5441 displayed the symptoms of the cold for a short period of time, he sneezed once, but within two hours he looked and felt fine. A blood test confirmed the Brutus strain was active and the cold was being neutralized. An hour later, 5441 began sweating and urinating heavily. These were symptoms, we believed, of the cold being flushed from the body. Nevertheless, we kept 5441 in quarantine overnight. \\n\\nI don’t know how we were able to move straight into human testing. Perhaps it was simply because we were working with nothing more than the common cold. After all, it wasn’t like we were working with smallpox or West Nile. Perhaps it was because, despite sharing almost 99% of our genetic makeup, there was enough of a difference that testing on chimpanzees would not have given us accurate or reliable data. We should have taken that precaution nevertheless. \\n\\nThe next morning we discovered irregularities in subject 5441’s sleep monitoring system. Throughout the night, 5441 displayed a high, irregular heartbeat and his sheets were soaked in sweat. Perhaps he had suffered from a nightmare. But upon interviewing him, he could not recall any nightmares. And he persisted sweating. Another blood test revealed the cold virus had indeed been neutralized and flushed from the body. Yet the Brutus strain was still active. This was entirely unexpected. We had designed Brutus to cling to the blood vessel walls and become dormant once it’s job was done, only to be reactivated once a different cold virus entered the body. We had also designed the virus to be harmless to humans, having no effect on the body or its systems. After the jubilation of what appeared to be a resounding success the previous day, this was an unexpected and disappointing setback. Yet we carried on with further testing, arrogant, certain that this setback could easily be rectified. Even when test subject 5441 began bleeding from his nose, we did not begin to grasp the gravity of our failure. \\n\\nThe next day, test subject 5441’s health had deteriorated a staggering amount. He complained of an intense, aching pain in his stomach, joints, and muscles. His breathing had become rapid. His skin, still clammy with sweat, appeared bloated as if air had been pumped just beneath its surface. His blood vessels appeared strained and overinflated beneath his skin. The nose bleed had not yet ceased. When we tried to draw more blood and run more tests he refused and resisted to the verge of violence, lashing out at us. We had to call in security to restrain him. Once restrained, we discovered his eyes had become extremely bloodshot. This minor setback was becoming an abstract failure. \\n\\nWe managed to draw more blood and other fluids for tests. The Brutus strain had gone from active to malevolent. Under the microscope, we could see the virus attacking and destroying white blood cells. What it did to red blood cells, however, was terrifying, but somehow also extraordinary. It would inject itself into the red blood cell, duplicate itself, and somehow rapidly accelerate the blood cells own growth and division. The incredibly high red blood cell count explained many of his symptoms such as the joint pain, strained blood vessels, and rapid breathing. But that was just the beginning. \\n\\nFrom the lab, we heard a scream from 5441’s quarantine cell. When we arrived we found 5441 sitting upright, unbuckling his leg restraints. A nurse was sitting in the corner crying and clutching her face. The nurse had just drawn more of his blood when 5441 had dislocated his own thumbs in order to slip out of the arm restraints, grab the syringe from the nurse, and jam it into her eye socket. She was now infected with the Brutus strain. 5441’s face had become almost purple in color, his veins and arteries strained and swollen beneath his skin. Blood flowed freely, not only from his nose, but now his eyes as well. His profuse sweating continued. His restraints undone, he lunged at us like an animal, knocking us to the ground. He leaped out the open door and sprinted down the hall. I slammed the emergency button on the wall and a siren blared, red lights flashing everywhere. In the lab there was a freezer which kept glass “pucks” with cultures of every strain we had yet worked with, including Brutus. They were flash frozen to nearly zero kelvin. If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. \\n\\nSecurity arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. \\n\\nThe facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. \\n\\nThe other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”\\n\\nTrying desperately to calm my nerves, I spoke smoothly and soothingly. I tried to talk him down, tried to talk him into putting the puck back into the freezer. I took a step forward. Wrong move. In an instant, he dropped the puck and it shattered on the ground. The guards lunged and tackled him. Pinning him on his stomach, they cuffed him. He was screaming incoherently, foam and spittle flying from his mouth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the virus culture fizzing on the ground. It was airborne. We are all infected. The guards tried hauling 5441 to his feet. As they did so, 5441 let out one last guttural scream. With a horrific sound like the slap of a wet towel, his body opened up. His abdomen, arms, and legs split open at unseen seems. His eyes burst like grapes. Blood flowed out of his ruined and shredded body like a satanic baptism. The floor became slick with the ungodly amount of blood from 5441. And that was it. Silence fell. We are all infected. \\n\\nIn writing this I am violating every non-disclosure agreement I signed for the company. Not that I care anymore. Code black protocol was initiated four minutes ago. It would take another three minutes for the jets and bombers to arrive and deliver their payload of brimstone and hellfire. There will be no lawsuit or legal action taken against me once by body is atomized by the military. There will also be no bloated paycheck, no Nobel prize for me. Now I sit in the control room with my colleagues. I am resigned to the fate of fire that comes for me. I am just hopeful the bombing neutralizes every molecule of this place. The virus cannot escape. It’s ironic, the name McNamara gave to the virus. Brutus. He named it so because we designed it to turn on and destroy other virus strains of its kind. But it turned on us, it’s creators, instead. How ironic.  \\n\\nOver the wails of the infected guard, I can hear the roar of jet engines in the distance. A squadron of fighter bombers, loaded with incendiary ordinance, is near. Soon fire will rain from them like the wrath of God. And with that, I hope, the threat of this virus will end. Et tu, Brute?',\n",

If the pucks were taken out and broken, the viruses would sublime and turn gaseous, airborne. 5441 had entered a state of insanity and we had to stop him before he reached the lab. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Security arrived to the cell. One stayed back to help us as the rest ran to the lab. Before we could stop him, he went to help the injured nurse. She was infected and he was not wearing a biohazard suit. He knelt down and removed her hands from her face, getting her blood on his own hands in the process. He removed the syringe from her ruined eye. But as he did so, she flinched involuntarily and the syringe slipped, fell, and landed in his thigh. The room froze. The guard slowly looked down to the syringe that had inserted itself into his thigh. He too, was now infected. He panicked. Crying and screaming of how he didn’t want to die, he ran to the door. We tried to block him but he was a bear of a man and knocked us over with ease. We couldn’t allow this crisis, or the virus to spread outside the facility. We had to stop the guard and subject 5441 at all costs. I instructed the other doctors to run to the control room, there they would have a birds eye view of every room in the facility through the security cameras. There they would also have the ability to initiate the code black protocol. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The facility, run by an extremely wealthy pharmaceutical company, had four security protocols; code green for when intruders broke into the facility; code orange for fires and natural disasters; code red for when test subjects or facility personnel became violent; and code black for when biological or chemical hazards were “mishandled” and threatened the security of the facility or the greater world. A code green protocol dictated a response from armed security guards and a detailed search of the facility. Code orange protocols initiated firefighting or search and rescue responses. Code red dictated another armed response, and if necessary, quarantine, arrest, or termination of any violent personnel. Code black alerted a nearby military airbase, which would then respond by dropping incendiary ordinance onto the facility until nothing remained but blackened, smoldering craters. Bombing would commence regardless of any personnel remaining in the facility. The company, and the military, had to do anything to stop a virus from spreading to the outside world, even if it meant sacrificing a few dozen lives. The nurse, despite her crying, was handling the situation with remarkable levelheadedness. Subject 5441, however, had lost his sanity, and the guard had panicked like a child. A code black protocol was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The other doctors ran to the control room. They knew what they had to do. I sprinted to the lab, hopeful I could help the guards stop 5441 from causing any more damage. When I arrived, I found one guard dead, his neck twisted and head facing a horribly wrong direction. I found another crouched on the ground clutching a shard of glass in his shoulder. The remaining two guards, uninjured, kept an uneasy distance from 5441. He was standing in front of the freezer. He was a horrific sight. His skin was beet red. Blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and ears. He was leaking blood from his pores. It appeared that capillaries had burst all over his body. His veins had become so engorged that his whole body appeared ropy and strained. In his hand, he held a puck labeled “Brutus.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying desperately to calm my nerves, I spoke smoothly and soothingly. I tried to talk him down, tried to talk him into putting the puck back into the freezer. I took a step forward. Wrong move. In an instant, he dropped the puck and it shattered on the ground. The guards lunged and tackled him. Pinning him on his stomach, they cuffed him. He was screaming incoherently, foam and spittle flying from his mouth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the virus culture fizzing on the ground. It was airborne. We are all infected. The guards tried hauling 5441 to his feet. As they did so, 5441 let out one last guttural scream. With a horrific sound like the slap of a wet towel, his body opened up. His abdomen, arms, and legs split open at unseen seems. His eyes burst like grapes. Blood flowed out of his ruined and shredded body like a satanic baptism. The floor became slick with the ungodly amount of blood from 5441. And that was it. Silence fell. We are all infected. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In writing this I am violating every non-disclosure agreement I signed for the company. Not that I care anymore. Code black protocol was initiated four minutes ago. It would take another three minutes for the jets and bombers to arrive and deliver their payload of brimstone and hellfire. There will be no lawsuit or legal action taken against me once by body is atomized by the military. There will also be no bloated paycheck, no Nobel prize for me. Now I sit in the control room with my colleagues. I am resigned to the fate of fire that comes for me. I am just hopeful the bombing neutralizes every molecule of this place. The virus cannot escape. It’s ironic, the name McNamara gave to the virus. Brutus. He named it so because we designed it to turn on and destroy other virus strains of its kind. But it turned on us, it’s creators, instead. How ironic.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the wails of the infected guard, I can hear the roar of jet engines in the distance. A squadron of fighter bombers, loaded with incendiary ordinance, is near. Soon fire will rain from them like the wrath of God. And with that, I hope, the threat of this virus will end. Et tu, Brute?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

A little back story, I have always been in touch with the other side, they use me a lot. Typically, I have no emotional connection with any spirit I come in contact with. This was different.\\n\\nAn important piece of information is that I have a six year old daughter. When I go outside, often times she will be directly on the other side of the front door and asking when I\\'ll be back in.\\n\\nIn the early afternoon, my wife and I had stepped outside for a few minutes. As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered \"yes dear\" just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.\\n\\nLater that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn\\'t out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.\\n\\nWhenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say \"momma\" just as a few hours earlier.

A little back story, I have always been in touch with the other side, they use me a lot. Typically, I have no emotional connection with any spirit I come in contact with. This was different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An important piece of information is that I have a six year old daughter. When I go outside, often times she will be directly on the other side of the front door and asking when I&amp;#39;ll be back in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the early afternoon, my wife and I had stepped outside for a few minutes. As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered &amp;quot;yes dear&amp;quot; just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn&amp;#39;t out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say &amp;quot;momma&amp;quot; just as a few hours earlier. My wife did not see her nor hear her, but she very clearly heard it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The age of this child is what mine would have been, had I not miscarried. The father is blonde with golden eyes. She had my curls and his chubby cheeks. I could just feel that she was my baby.

Mostly they'd be about strange and random things but didn't bother me much, and I enjoyed telling friends about them.\\n\\nHowever, recently I've noticed that my dreams have become quite strange.\\n\\nPretty much since I turned 16  in Dec, the same girl has appeared in my dreams. What I find strange is not only how I can remember her face quite clearly, but also how I seem to see her in another time, like it's a past life. I cannot possibly describe all of my dreams with her in detail, as each one would be at least 2000 words long. I will provide a few though, in italics.\\n\\n*The first time I met her we seemed to be in a garden, with a wooden swing bench and a tree in the middle. I waited there and then she appeared under the tree, I kissed her and then we made out on the bench. We then went down to a city and flew around and even walked through shops and streets, but we were still invisible to everyone else. At some point I did become visible at will though, scaring a man in a bookstore, which I thought was funny. The dream ended with us departing on a boat somewhere. The landscape was not natural at all. I believe this dream was more of a symbolic one than literal one, and a few of my dreams with her are like that.*\\n\\nAlthough I'm not a heavily spiritual person, I do believe these are past life dreams.Some of the past life dreams are more normal though, like us going to a beach or a town for example. Other ones do not feature her at all, and are just memories of another family or moments by myself. For timelines sake, I believe the ones with her took place in the very late 90s, especially how I remember watching in a cinema and also seeing an advert for Ep.1 of Star Wars, which came out in 1999 I believe. My relationship with her seems to be quite a close one, I'm quite sure homosexual, though I don't understand how we would have hidden that since homophobia was still common in the 90s. We seem to have a car as well, though I think it is more likely hers since she has driven it in all of the occasions I have seen her. It's a red car, I don't know the model but it seems to be from the late 80s or early 90s. I have searched online for one similar with no luck. I have also tried searching for the locations in my dreams on google maps, but I gave up a few days later realising it will take a lifetime. I would also like to add that I have seen a very similar car in real life after those dreams, but only twice. It was quite elusive both times though, I didn't get to see a driver or model.\\n\\nThis is where things become even more spiritual, though. Recently I haven't dreamt of her I don't think, but there have been many strange signs irl. For example, last Friday I decided to go on a small walk before returning home. I didn't go far, just down a street near my own house. At one of the dead ends of this street is a wall overlooking a graveyard. I just wanted to know if there was a bench I could read on so I looked over it. When I turned back around to return home, I walked a bit then found a plain brown glass marble leaning against the kerb. I picked it up, and it instantly reminded me of her. It was kind of chipped in some places, but I still thought it was nice. It had a warm aura to it, it reminded me of her eyes and her seemingly gentle nature. The next evening a bead I found like 2 years ago was on the floor next to me for some reason whilst I was doing revision. I was certain I had kept it in a drawer somewhere, but just guessed I might have taken it out accidentally. I believe it's a rosary bead, but I'm not too sure. It's wooden and spherical with a small hole, but seems to have a glossy layer over it and the wood shines when rolled in light.\\n\\nBefore I went to sleep last night, I remembered that meditation does help me sleep sometimes, so I decided to try it out again. However, this time I held the marble and bead in a hand each, meditating for about 2 minutes. I don't know why I did that, out of curiosity maybe? I managed to fall asleep better than usual though, however the dream I had was not normal at all, even for me.\\n\\n*I was in a dense forest, and it was quite dark, but not night. The sky was grey like it was about to rain heavily. The trees had some leaves, but they were quite faded, either dark green or brown. The area I was in had some wooden structures, like huts and walled areas made out of wooden planks. But they had been completely abandoned. I suddenly felt like I was being watched, so I found my way out of that area. I found a clearing which  was wooden decking over a very circular lake or pool. It had 5 symmetrical pentagonal huts which were all different colours and left to rot. One of them i remember had dark blue tarpaulin with white or yellow stars covering it. I still had a strong feeling of being watched, but from behind me, and I began running around the clearing looking for a place to hide or leave as I panicked. I stopped and glanced into the woods to my right. A dark figure or shadow met me when I stopped. It stared directly at me, and I couldn't tell if it was a pace ahead of me or a pace behind. Before I could do anything, I was in a car park, behind some run down buildings. There was a few vans and no one was around. The feeling was strong, and I instantly closed my eyes. I didn't want to see anything. I looked towards the ground. Through the slits of my eyes i could see it standing right in front of me. The fear became intimidation, but the moment before I woke up it suddenly felt reassuring. I woke up after that in the dead of night and my room was silent but i felt like i was being watched, it was an intense feeling, almost like someone was actually there. I was too scared to check though, since this has never happened to me so strongly before. I just faced the wall and instantly went back to sleep which is weird for me.*\\n\\nIn addition to this, today at 15:41 I noticed my ear had become infected, which I thought was very strange since I take very good care of my piercings and just my hygiene in general. As I arrived home at about 15:50, I helped my mother with the shopping, and she noticed a small object on the floor. She did not recognise it, and asked me if it was mine. I took it from her and later inspected it. At first I thought it was a brooche or pin, however after further inspection I realised it was an earring that had the metal stick thing bent. It was a small silver owl with black gemstone eyes, and a larger grey gemstone stomach. I found an earring after my ear became suddenly infected, I thought this was odd.\\n\\nI think that maybe these objects are left by her for me, kind of like little presents or what's on my mind. The marble can be due to the fact that in the past week I was thinking about how I used to find marbles a lot as a child, along with other random things. Then the earring could be a result of my ear being infected. But since I found a lot of things as a child, does this mean she was always around?\\n\\nI don't have much else to say right at this moment, other than that whenever I seem to speak of someone in any manner they seem to either appear in real life or join a voice chat instantly. Also, whenever I get bad vibes from someone, I always turn out to be right these days.\\n\\nI've woken up crying after these dreams a few times, since I feel immense sorrow deep down somewhere after them, but I also feel joy after I see her.\\n\\nIt's been on my mind for months, I'd be really grateful for any kind of explanation, and for advice on what I can do to get some kind of stronger connection with her, to see her more in my dreams properly and maybe communicate with her safely.\\n\\nIf you have read this far down then thank you, it means a lot.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_7b6h6g', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Odd dreams/Haunting from a past life?', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Advice'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Paranormal', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'f', 'downs': 0, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_fg0la7', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 5, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Advice', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 5, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1583783645.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1583812165.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.Paranormal', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(sorry I know this is quite long, and I&amp;#39;m new here)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had quite vivid dreams, even when I was very young. Mostly they&amp;#39;d be about strange and random things but didn&amp;#39;t bother me much, and I enjoyed telling friends about them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, recently I&amp;#39;ve noticed that my dreams have become quite strange.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much since I turned 16  in Dec, the same girl has appeared in my dreams. What I find strange is not only how I can remember her face quite clearly, but also how I seem to see her in another time, like it&amp;#39;s a past life. I cannot possibly describe all of my dreams with her in detail, as each one would be at least 2000 words long. I will provide a few though, in italics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first time I met her we seemed to be in a garden, with a wooden swing bench and a tree in the middle. I waited there and then she appeared under the tree, I kissed her and then we made out on the bench. We then went down to a city and flew around and even walked through shops and streets, but we were still invisible to everyone else. At some point I did become visible at will though, scaring a man in a bookstore, which I thought was funny. The dream ended with us departing on a boat somewhere. The landscape was not natural at all. I believe this dream was more of a symbolic one than literal one, and a few of my dreams with her are like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;m not a heavily spiritual person, I do believe these are past life dreams.Some of the past life dreams are more normal though, like us going to a beach or a town for example. Other ones do not feature her at all, and are just memories of another family or moments by myself. For timelines sake, I believe the ones with her took place in the very late 90s, especially how I remember watching in a cinema and also seeing an advert for Ep.1 of Star Wars, which came out in 1999 I believe. My relationship with her seems to be quite a close one, I&amp;#39;m quite sure homosexual, though I don&amp;#39;t understand how we would have hidden that since homophobia was still common in the 90s. We seem to have a car as well, though I think it is more likely hers since she has driven it in all of the occasions I have seen her. It&amp;#39;s a red car, I don&amp;#39;t know the model but it seems to be from the late 80s or early 90s. I have searched online for one similar with no luck. I have also tried searching for the locations in my dreams on google maps, but I gave up a few days later realising it will take a lifetime. I would also like to add that I have seen a very similar car in real life after those dreams, but only twice. It was quite elusive both times though, I didn&amp;#39;t get to see a driver or model.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is where things become even more spiritual, though. Recently I haven&amp;#39;t dreamt of her I don&amp;#39;t think, but there have been many strange signs irl. For example, last Friday I decided to go on a small walk before returning home. I didn&amp;#39;t go far, just down a street near my own house. At one of the dead ends of this street is a wall overlooking a graveyard. I just wanted to know if there was a bench I could read on so I looked over it. When I turned back around to return home, I walked a bit then found a plain brown glass marble leaning against the kerb. I picked it up, and it instantly reminded me of her. It was kind of chipped in some places, but I still thought it was nice. It had a warm aura to it, it reminded me of her eyes and her seemingly gentle nature. The next evening a bead I found like 2 years ago was on the floor next to me for some reason whilst I was doing revision. I was certain I had kept it in a drawer somewhere, but just guessed I might have taken it out accidentally. I believe it&amp;#39;s a rosary bead, but I&amp;#39;m not too sure. It&amp;#39;s wooden and spherical with a small hole, but seems to have a glossy layer over it and the wood shines when rolled in light.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I went to sleep last night, I remembered that meditation does help me sleep sometimes, so I decided to try it out again. However, this time I held the marble and bead in a hand each, meditating for about 2 minutes. I don&amp;#39;t know why I did that, out of curiosity maybe? I managed to fall asleep better than usual though, however the dream I had was not normal at all, even for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was in a dense forest, and it was quite dark, but not night. The sky was grey like it was about to rain heavily. The trees had some leaves, but they were quite faded, either dark green or brown. The area I was in had some wooden structures, like huts and walled areas made out of wooden planks. But they had been completely abandoned. I suddenly felt like I was being watched, so I found my way out of that area. I found a clearing which  was wooden decking over a very circular lake or pool. It had 5 symmetrical pentagonal huts which were all different colours and left to rot. One of them i remember had dark blue tarpaulin with white or yellow stars covering it. I still had a strong feeling of being watched, but from behind me, and I began running around the clearing looking for a place to hide or leave as I panicked. I stopped and glanced into the woods to my right. A dark figure or shadow met me when I stopped. It stared directly at me, and I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was a pace ahead of me or a pace behind. Before I could do anything, I was in a car park, behind some run down buildings. There was a few vans and no one was around. The feeling was strong, and I instantly closed my eyes. I didn&amp;#39;t want to see anything. I looked towards the ground. Through the slits of my eyes i could see it standing right in front of me. The fear became intimidation, but the moment before I woke up it suddenly felt reassuring. I woke up after that in the dead of night and my room was silent but i felt like i was being watched, it was an intense feeling, almost like someone was actually there. I was too scared to check though, since this has never happened to me so strongly before. I just faced the wall and instantly went back to sleep which is weird for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, today at 15:41 I noticed my ear had become infected, which I thought was very strange since I take very good care of my piercings and just my hygiene in general.

We got the idea of returning to the house and so we did. We managed to get in this time, and we had a look round.

There was a large basement with furnaces and oven etc. All the rooms were pretty similar and we soon left as there wasn’t an awful amount to do.\\n\\nAnyway, to the point. Recently me and two other friends decided to go back to the house. We were bored and figured it would be fun. It was around 8pm when we left so it was pitch black. The house backed onto a field so we chose to get to it from there. It was about a 15 minute walk from my house so it didn’t take us long. We entered the field and began trudging towards the house. \\n\\nWe were slightly nervous, but we had done this before so it was nothing to be scared about. We slowly approached the back of the house, observing the windows (there were 5). It was very dark, but we did have a powerful torch so we had no trouble seeing. There was a fence surrounding the back of the house so in order to get in we would have to climb over this. My friend volunteered to go first and as he began climbing we heard the most terrifying sound. The word ‘meow’ came from inside of the house. We all froze. This was not a cat. Someone had mimicked the noise of a cat from inside of that house. For a split second we did nothing, and then we ran.\\n\\nAs we ran, a horrifying, cackling laugh came bellowing out of the house. We said nothing to each other we just sprinted towards the exit of the field. I was petrified and I was playing the noise over and over in my head, grimacing at who or what it could have been. When we got to the road we stopped running to catch our breath. We tried to discuss what had happened but none of us had answers, it was truly terrifying. We slowly calmed down as we walked towards my house and figured maybe it was somebody messing around.

We decided to cut through the mere to get to town as it was the quickest way, so we did. It was about 9pm by this point and any light was totally gone. I still had my touch, but we encountered a couple of walkers at the mere so I decided to turn it off so I wouldn’t blind anyone walking towards us. We walked and spoke as we entered the mere and it takes about 10 minutes to get round to the entrance to the town. It was very quiet, apart from our chatter there was no sound at all.

I think I will tell this story in the order events as I found out about them, rather than how they chronologically occurred.\\n\\nTo begin, I have this recurring dream that I\\'ve been having since middle school. I have it one or two times a year, but it\\'s slowed down since I\\'ve gotten older. In the dream I\\'m at home, but it isn\\'t my house. It\\'s a big 2 or 3 story home that\\'s shaped like a U. I\\'ve never seen anything like it before. I go upstairs to my mom\\'s room in this dream and she\\'s on the bed, seizing. My first thought is that she must be possessed. I call my brother in a panic and tell him mom is possessed. He just asks me if we need more bread or milk, because he\\'s grocery shopping. We fight back and forth, he refuses to listen, and I eventually hang up and try to help my mom myself. Before I can do anything she stops seizing and looks out the window. I run to the window that overlooks the pool (in the middle of the U). I see a spirit flying into (out of?) the pool. I don\\'t hear anything but I know his name is Chris. My mom is fine again.\\n\\nIt\\'s a weird dream to keep having, but I\\'ve never thought too much of it. \\n\\nMoving forward to when I was in college. There was a Ouija board that had been on the game shelf of my house for as long as I can remember. None of us have ever touched it or played it, but it has always been there. I asked if I could take it with me to college. I thought it would be fun for my friends and I to use. I\\'ve been very interested in paranormal, but never really believed in it. I take it, and the first time I use it, I ask if it knows me. It says yes. I ask how. It spells MAMA. I disregard it, my friends I use it several times after that. Nothing particularly interesting really happens in the hundreds of other uses.\\n\\nOne night, a few years later, my family is all sitting in a hot tub late at night in late fall in our backyard. We were just looking at the stars but my little brother suggested we tell ghost stories. No one could come up with any, so we started talking about weird dreams and the meanings behind them instead. I offered to share mine, as I recently had one that I had several times before.\\n\\nI tell this dream to my family and my mom and dad turn their necks so quickly to look at each other I swear I hear them crack. I ask them what\\'s wrong and they say Chris is just someone from their past. They act awfully strange for a bit before my mom says that she does, actually, have a ghost story.\\n\\nWhen my parents were teenagers and still dating my mom bought a Ouija board (the same one I took with me to college). She convinced my dad to use it with her and the had fun asking it questions about their future and what not. They ask several questions about their future and specifically, it if they\\'ll ever have their own cars. It answers \"Grand Prix.\" They asked for the name of the ghost their speaking to and it said *Christopher.* They didn\\'t really play with it again due to just lack of interest.\\n\\nSeveral months (maybe years?) after their first experience, my mom buys her first car. Lo and behold, it\\'s a Grand Prix. I think the fact that the Ouija board predicted that was a realization they had several months after the purchase. Could be chocked up to subconscious, but a little weird.\\n\\n**I will refer to my mom as \"M\" from here on**\\n\\nSeveral months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They\\'re there for a Superbowl party, I think. They\\'re out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said \"M\\'s GP\".\\n\\nShe gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They\\'re loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.\\n\\n\"Is your name M?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, it\\'s my Grand Prix, why?\"\\n\\n\"My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying \"where M, where M?\"\\n\\nShe did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.\\n\\nNow, to top things off, I\\'m working at my first job after college. I\\'ve been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U.

I think I will tell this story in the order events as I found out about them, rather than how they chronologically occurred.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To begin, I have this recurring dream that I&amp;#39;ve been having since middle school. I have it one or two times a year, but it&amp;#39;s slowed down since I&amp;#39;ve gotten older. In the dream I&amp;#39;m at home, but it isn&amp;#39;t my house. It&amp;#39;s a big 2 or 3 story home that&amp;#39;s shaped like a U. I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like it before. I go upstairs to my mom&amp;#39;s room in this dream and she&amp;#39;s on the bed, seizing. My first thought is that she must be possessed. I call my brother in a panic and tell him mom is possessed. He just asks me if we need more bread or milk, because he&amp;#39;s grocery shopping. We fight back and forth, he refuses to listen, and I eventually hang up and try to help my mom myself. Before I can do anything she stops seizing and looks out the window. I run to the window that overlooks the pool (in the middle of the U). I see a spirit flying into (out of?) the pool. I don&amp;#39;t hear anything but I know his name is Chris. My mom is fine again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a weird dream to keep having, but I&amp;#39;ve never thought too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Moving forward to when I was in college. There was a Ouija board that had been on the game shelf of my house for as long as I can remember. None of us have ever touched it or played it, but it has always been there. I asked if I could take it with me to college. I thought it would be fun for my friends and I to use. I&amp;#39;ve been very interested in paranormal, but never really believed in it. I take it, and the first time I use it, I ask if it knows me. It says yes. I ask how. It spells MAMA. I disregard it, my friends I use it several times after that. Nothing particularly interesting really happens in the hundreds of other uses.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One night, a few years later, my family is all sitting in a hot tub late at night in late fall in our backyard. We were just looking at the stars but my little brother suggested we tell ghost stories. No one could come up with any, so we started talking about weird dreams and the meanings behind them instead. I offered to share mine, as I recently had one that I had several times before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tell this dream to my family and my mom and dad turn their necks so quickly to look at each other I swear I hear them crack. I ask them what&amp;#39;s wrong and they say Chris is just someone from their past. They act awfully strange for a bit before my mom says that she does, actually, have a ghost story.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When my parents were teenagers and still dating my mom bought a Ouija board (the same one I took with me to college). She convinced my dad to use it with her and the had fun asking it questions about their future and what not. They ask several questions about their future and specifically, it if they&amp;#39;ll ever have their own cars. It answers &amp;quot;Grand Prix.&amp;quot; They asked for the name of the ghost their speaking to and it said &lt;em&gt;Christopher.&lt;/em&gt; They didn&amp;#39;t really play with it again due to just lack of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several months (maybe years?) after their first experience, my mom buys her first car. Lo and behold, it&amp;#39;s a Grand Prix. I think the fact that the Ouija board predicted that was a realization they had several months after the purchase. Could be chocked up to subconscious, but a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will refer to my mom as &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; from here on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They&amp;#39;re there for a Superbowl party, I think. They&amp;#39;re out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said &amp;quot;M&amp;#39;s GP&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They&amp;#39;re loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is your name M?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s my Grand Prix, why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying &amp;quot;where M, where M?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to top things off, I&amp;#39;m working at my first job after college. I&amp;#39;ve been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U. It is nearly identical to the one from my dream, save for the fact there&amp;#39;s a courtyard instead of a pool in the center.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear any thoughts. It definitely feels like someone is looking for my mom, and now going through me to find her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s worth noting but my mom also seems to have a sort of sixth sense?

She then called my aunt (who is b spiritual and connected) and asked, she told my mom that was my guardian angel trying to warn me about a threat to/in my life.

I also asked to send a handsome one and, not a terrifying one. I feel bad that I shut him out but, I can’t keep screaming awake. \\n\\nA lot of people I’ve read say that they hear their guardian angel or angel speak to them but, I haven’t read or heard of them seeing them fully. \\n \\nPlease share your experience if it’s similar to mine!

So, I just started praying to god to let me out of it and, as I said it I felt the light shutter away and I could open my eyes. Needless to say, I slept w in my parents room w my mom that night. I woke up at 6 again and, at the foot of my bed is the same figure but he’s not curious anymore just watching. I began screaming unknowingly again and, as soon as my mom touched me he whisped away again. \\nThat morning I told my mom adamant about what I saw. She then called my aunt (who is b spiritual and connected) and asked, she told my mom that was my guardian angel trying to warn me about a threat to/in my life. She said I’m lucky if I can see him and not many can say they have. \\nSo, the next night before I went to bed I prayed to god to never show me him again because, whatever threat was possibly in my life I think the Angel he sent would take me sooner than that w a heart attack. I also asked to send a handsome one and, not a terrifying one. I feel bad that I shut him out but, I can’t keep screaming awake. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people I’ve read say that they hear their guardian angel or angel speak to them but, I haven’t read or heard of them seeing them fully. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please share your experience if it’s similar to mine!

On our way back, at about halfway out,  we heard a loud sobbing sound coming from several metres behind us. To me, it sounded like a woman drawing out her sobbing for a few seconds and then stopping.

There would be a period of silence, then the sound would repeat, with each repeat coming up closer next to us (to our left, still within the forest).

       "   'selftext': \"This happened a few years ago on a camping trip, but it feels like yesterday. \\n\\nMe and my friend, both teen girls at the time, were sleeping a few yards from her aunt's trailer in a little tent. After goofing off for a while, we settled down. I faced one side of the tent, she faced the other.\\n\\nI was just starting to fall asleep when I could tell a bright light was illuminating the tent (you know how you can tell the lights are on, even when your eyes are closed?). Assuming it was a car or something of the sort driving by, I kept trying to sleep. I heard an odd scratching sound as well, but didn't think much about it. I felt my friend tap my shoulder, but for some reason thought she had just rolled over while sleeping and had done it by accident. \\n\\nFinally, after another tap to the shoulder, I slowly and quietly turned to face her side of the tent. \\n\\nThere was an incredibly bright light, brighter than any flashlight I've seen, pointing straight at the tent. There was only one point of light, so it couldn't have been a car. The best comparison I could draw is a motorcycle, but we would have heard a motorcycle approach the tent, or any vehicle for that matter. This wasn't the scary part, though. \\n\\nIt looked as though some kind of hooked saw-like object was being dragged slowly against the fabric of the tent, and made very much visible by the abrasive light, but we could not see anything holding it up. Then, the light just switched off and we didn't hear or see anything else that night. \\n\\nWhen we worked up the courage to book it the few yards to the trailer her aunt was in, we didn't see anyone or anything out of place outside. After we got inside, she told me that before I had turned around to look at whatever she had seen, multiple shapes similar to the weird hooked saw thing were very clearly dragged against the tent, still with nothing seeming to hold them up. All equally terrifying and sharp looking, but nothing like I'd ever seen. Looked like the contents of a toolbox from hell.\\n\\nNot exactly the most terrifying, but it absolutely rattled me to my core and I still cannot explain it. \\n\\nTL;DR weird light came from outside tent, someone or something dragged a bunch of weird tools(?) across the surface of the tent, then it all just disappeared.\",\n",

After goofing off for a while, we settled down. I faced one side of the tent, she faced the other.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was just starting to fall asleep when I could tell a bright light was illuminating the tent (you know how you can tell the lights are on, even when your eyes are closed?). Assuming it was a car or something of the sort driving by, I kept trying to sleep. I heard an odd scratching sound as well, but didn&amp;#39;t think much about it. I felt my friend tap my shoulder, but for some reason thought she had just rolled over while sleeping and had done it by accident. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, after another tap to the shoulder, I slowly and quietly turned to face her side of the tent. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was an incredibly bright light, brighter than any flashlight I&amp;#39;ve seen, pointing straight at the tent. There was only one point of light, so it couldn&amp;#39;t have been a car. The best comparison I could draw is a motorcycle, but we would have heard a motorcycle approach the tent, or any vehicle for that matter. This wasn&amp;#39;t the scary part, though. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It looked as though some kind of hooked saw-like object was being dragged slowly against the fabric of the tent, and made very much visible by the abrasive light, but we could not see anything holding it up. Then, the light just switched off and we didn&amp;#39;t hear or see anything else that night. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we worked up the courage to book it the few yards to the trailer her aunt was in, we didn&amp;#39;t see anyone or anything out of place outside. After we got inside, she told me that before I had turned around to look at whatever she had seen, multiple shapes similar to the weird hooked saw thing were very clearly dragged against the tent, still with nothing seeming to hold them up. All equally terrifying and sharp looking, but nothing like I&amp;#39;d ever seen. Looked like the contents of a toolbox from hell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not exactly the most terrifying, but it absolutely rattled me to my core and I still cannot explain it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR weird light came from outside tent, someone or something dragged a bunch of weird tools(?) across the surface of the tent, then it all just disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I believe in the paranormal, but with a healthy dose of skepticism. For example, I believe most instances of \\'orbs\\' are just dust motes illuminated by camera flash. Nor is every decrepit abandoned house haunted. Though when you brush with something, especially a disruptive something, it has a distinct feel. \\n\\nOver the last year, I\\'ve had a handful of recognizable brushes with something that just doesn\\'t like me. The feeling is mutual. \\n\\nA year ago my girlfriend invited me to move in with her full time. I\\'d stayed over before for a weekend. Nothing seemed off about the place, or the living arrangement. I didn\\'t get goose pimples, or a sense of dread when I roamed around the place. Shortly after her invitation, I chose to move in with her.\\n\\nShe was rather insistent that I move in immediately. I decided just to pull up stakes and find a job in the area after I moved in. This meant I spent most of the day alone in the house.\\n\\nIt took a lot longer than I thought it would to get an entry level job in the area. After a while, I took to laying in bed for an hour or two out of the day. That\\'s when I started to notice strange noises.\\n\\nThey sounded like radio commercials, and music. Though I could never quite make out what was said. The voices had the tones of males &amp; females, but all I could hear was garbled nonsense. Just recall radio commercials for local businesses, interspersed with semi-discordant \\'music\\', and you\\'re probably close to the mark.\\n\\nA little while after that, I started having vivid jarring dreams. In one I was holding an infant then I had a seizure, and started squeezing the baby. I couldn\\'t let go, and it had a horrified look on it\\'s face. That woke me up, and once I could go back to sleep I was hit with another.\\n\\nThe next one came as soon as I went back to sleep. I was standing in a backyard, then I heard young children\\'s panicked screaming. I ran inside, just to see a toddler age child running out the front door with an infant slung over their shoulder.\\n\\nI got to the toddler, and infant, in the driveway where the toddler dropped the baby. The baby started vomiting a large amount of green fluid. I woke up just as I had picked up the infant, and went to call for medics. Immediately upon waking, I clearly heard; \"Every smart homeowner knows....\", and it faded away. \\n\\nWe didn\\'t have a radio, or television on. It seemed like the same kind of commercial mimicry, but with more clarity.  \\n\\nOn another night, I woke up to a hard slap on the side of my head. I saw my girlfriend standing over me, with tears running down her cheeks. She disappeared when I yelled; \"Why the hell did you hit me?!?!?!\" To which my girlfriend, laying next to me all along, sleepily stated; \"I didn\\'t hit you. What are you talking about?\"\\n\\nA couple weeks after that, my girlfriend went to bed earlier than I. I was on my computer in the finished basement, almost directly under the bedroom. After a few hours she messaged me, and asked me to come upstairs. She said it sounded like there was a block party outside, and she heard people talking outside the window.\\n\\nIf there had been anything like that, I would have heard it as well. I heard nothing of the sort, whilst in pretty much the same side of the house. The neighborhood had been quiet all night, for me, at least.\\n\\nWe resolved to move the bed, just in case we were picking up radio broadcasts or some other odd signal. She had heard the same things as well, before I moved in. The adjustment seemed to significantly cut down on the odd \\'commercial\\' noises. Though I noticed them for a couple of seconds, especially when tensions between her and I were elevated.\\n\\nOver the coming months, there were a host of other small odd occurrences. After the basement became unnaturally cold, I began to feel like I wasn\\'t alone. I would catch brief glimpses of a naked man, facing away from me, in the basement. I had a general feeling I wasn\\'t welcome.\\n\\nThe worst instance happened when I was in the middle of remodeling the basement half bath. I went from sweating, to practically freezing in an instant. I felt like something was standing just behind and off to the side, with about as much directed menace as I\\'d ever felt.\\n\\nI\\'m not religious, but I started naming as many saints as I could remember while I finished my process. Then I got the hell out of there, and decided I would stream some games from the basement PC to the upstairs television while my girlfriend slept in. I started having all kinds of bandwidth problems, then somehow I was signed out of my account. To my knowledge, that needs to be done manually. \\n\\nShortly after that, she woke up from a bad dream. She was with her mother, and they came back to her mother\\'s house to find the door ajar. They found her cats had been messily slaughtered, and fed to dogs with various antisemitic epithets spray painted on them. \\n\\nAll throughout this time, our relationship deteriorated. She would become physically violent at times. All I could do was block her, and attempt to restrain her. This eventually became emotionally abusive as well. The shark-like look of pure hate in her eyes is the most disturbing. Like the woman I know just wasn\\'t there.\\n\\nI kept waking up in the middle of the night, flailing. I felt under attack. One night I bashed my hand on the nightstand. Another night I woke up outside, fully clothed. She said I was acting like a lunatic. \\n\\nIt all became too much for me, and I moved out. I worry about her, so we still keep in contact. Yet another strange thing happened last night.\\n\\nWe were talking on the phone but I eventually became too tired, and fell asleep. She stayed on the line, because listening to me sleep helps calm her. When I woke up, we were disconnected. I checked my messages, and she wanted me to call her back. \\n\\nI blearily called her back, and started to go back to sleep. I heard a faint voice on the line, which I brushed off as some podcast on her tablet until she started \\'responding to me\\'. I perked up a bit, and heard a voice that sounded like mine. Though I couldn\\'t make out what was being said.\\n\\nI asked her who she was talking to, which confused her. She thought she was talking to me. I asked her what the voice had said to her, and she said it sounded like me asking her if she was doing okay - if she had found a job. I told her I had said nothing, though I had heard something that sounded like me.\\n\\nNaturally this unsettled her, as we both know something is wrong in the house. I don\\'t know if there\\'s something in the house itself, or if it can be tied to a certain relic she has. It\\'s a Chokwe (tribe from Angola) mask, which symbolizes a mother being separated from her child as he enters manhood. I\\'ve urged her to donate it to some curator, as there are several in the area. \\n\\nThe tribe itself is known to use their crafts as commodities, so I can\\'t be certain about that angle. Though I know something in that house is disruptive, and loves to do it.',\n",

This meant I spent most of the day alone in the house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It took a lot longer than I thought it would to get an entry level job in the area. After a while, I took to laying in bed for an hour or two out of the day. That&amp;#39;s when I started to notice strange noises.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They sounded like radio commercials, and music. Though I could never quite make out what was said. The voices had the tones of males &amp;amp; females, but all I could hear was garbled nonsense. Just recall radio commercials for local businesses, interspersed with semi-discordant &amp;#39;music&amp;#39;, and you&amp;#39;re probably close to the mark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A little while after that, I started having vivid jarring dreams. In one I was holding an infant then I had a seizure, and started squeezing the baby. I couldn&amp;#39;t let go, and it had a horrified look on it&amp;#39;s face. That woke me up, and once I could go back to sleep I was hit with another.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next one came as soon as I went back to sleep. I was standing in a backyard, then I heard young children&amp;#39;s panicked screaming. I ran inside, just to see a toddler age child running out the front door with an infant slung over their shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got to the toddler, and infant, in the driveway where the toddler dropped the baby. The baby started vomiting a large amount of green fluid. I woke up just as I had picked up the infant, and went to call for medics. Immediately upon waking, I clearly heard; &amp;quot;Every smart homeowner knows....&amp;quot;, and it faded away. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t have a radio, or television on. It seemed like the same kind of commercial mimicry, but with more clarity.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On another night, I woke up to a hard slap on the side of my head. I saw my girlfriend standing over me, with tears running down her cheeks. She disappeared when I yelled; &amp;quot;Why the hell did you hit me?!?!?!&amp;quot; To which my girlfriend, laying next to me all along, sleepily stated; &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t hit you. What are you talking about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks after that, my girlfriend went to bed earlier than I. I was on my computer in the finished basement, almost directly under the bedroom. After a few hours she messaged me, and asked me to come upstairs. She said it sounded like there was a block party outside, and she heard people talking outside the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If there had been anything like that, I would have heard it as well. I heard nothing of the sort, whilst in pretty much the same side of the house. The neighborhood had been quiet all night, for me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We resolved to move the bed, just in case we were picking up radio broadcasts or some other odd signal. She had heard the same things as well, before I moved in. The adjustment seemed to significantly cut down on the odd &amp;#39;commercial&amp;#39; noises. Though I noticed them for a couple of seconds, especially when tensions between her and I were elevated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, there were a host of other small odd occurrences. After the basement became unnaturally cold, I began to feel like I wasn&amp;#39;t alone. I would catch brief glimpses of a naked man, facing away from me, in the basement. I had a general feeling I wasn&amp;#39;t welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The worst instance happened when I was in the middle of remodeling the basement half bath. I went from sweating, to practically freezing in an instant. I felt like something was standing just behind and off to the side, with about as much directed menace as I&amp;#39;d ever felt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not religious, but I started naming as many saints as I could remember while I finished my process. Then I got the hell out of there, and decided I would stream some games from the basement PC to the upstairs television while my girlfriend slept in. I started having all kinds of bandwidth problems, then somehow I was signed out of my account. To my knowledge, that needs to be done manually. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, she woke up from a bad dream. She was with her mother, and they came back to her mother&amp;#39;s house to find the door ajar. They found her cats had been messily slaughtered, and fed to dogs with various antisemitic epithets spray painted on them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All throughout this time, our relationship deteriorated. She would become physically violent at times. All I could do was block her, and attempt to restrain her. This eventually became emotionally abusive as well. The shark-like look of pure hate in her eyes is the most disturbing. Like the woman I know just wasn&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I kept waking up in the middle of the night, flailing. I felt under attack. One night I bashed my hand on the nightstand. Another night I woke up outside, fully clothed. She said I was acting like a lunatic. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It all became too much for me, and I moved out. I worry about her, so we still keep in contact. Yet another strange thing happened last night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were talking on the phone but I eventually became too tired, and fell asleep. She stayed on the line, because listening to me sleep helps calm her. When I woke up, we were disconnected. I checked my messages, and she wanted me to call her back. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blearily called her back, and started to go back to sleep. I heard a faint voice on the line, which I brushed off as some podcast on her tablet until she started &amp;#39;responding to me&amp;#39;. I perked up a bit, and heard a voice that sounded like mine. Though I couldn&amp;#39;t make out what was being said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her who she was talking to, which confused her. She thought she was talking to me. I asked her what the voice had said to her, and she said it sounded like me asking her if she was doing okay - if she had found a job. I told her I had said nothing, though I had heard something that sounded like me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally this unsettled her, as we both know something is wrong in the house. I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s something in the house itself, or if it can be tied to a certain relic she has. It&amp;#39;s a Chokwe (tribe from Angola) mask, which symbolizes a mother being separated from her child as he enters manhood. I&amp;#39;ve urged her to donate it to some curator, as there are several in the area. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The tribe itself is known to use their crafts as commodities, so I can&amp;#39;t be certain about that angle. Though I know something in that house is disruptive, and loves to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'On mobile so I apologize for formatting and any errors.\\n\\nThis is a little bit difficult to talk about, as it happened last Thursday night and is still very emotional. A little back story, I have always been in touch with the other side, they use me a lot. Typically, I have no emotional connection with any spirit I come in contact with. This was different.\\n\\nAn important piece of information is that I have a six year old daughter. When I go outside, often times she will be directly on the other side of the front door and asking when I\\'ll be back in.\\n\\nIn the early afternoon, my wife and I had stepped outside for a few minutes. As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered \"yes dear\" just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.\\n\\nLater that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn\\'t out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.\\n\\nWhenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say \"momma\" just as a few hours earlier. My wife did not see her nor hear her, but she very clearly heard it the first time.\\n\\nThe age of this child is what mine would have been, had I not miscarried. The father is blonde with golden eyes. She had my curls and his chubby cheeks. I could just feel that she was my baby. She came to me because I needed something to keep me going.\\n\\nTl;dr : I met the ghost of my miscarried daughter in a time of need, and boy, was she beautiful.',\n",

As usual, I heard a little girl on the other side of the door. Not so usual, this little girl said momma. My daughter always calls me mommy or mom. I answered &amp;quot;yes dear&amp;quot; just as I always would, but there was no response from the other side of the door. I realized that my daughter was playing in her room the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later that night, my wife and I were laying in bed scrolling reddit and my six year old had only just fallen asleep. I heard what sounded like 6yo getting out of bed. I waited for her to come to our door, but she never showed. I got up to check on her, she was still very much asleep. I crawled back into bed and after a few moments, I heard it again. We have cats, so hearing noises at night isn&amp;#39;t out of the ordinary. I thought nothing of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever 6yo is standing in my doorway, I can feel it. Awake or asleep, I feel it. Well, I had that same feeling after hearing the noise again. I turned around expecting to see my dark haired green eyed daughter, only the child I saw was so blonde her hair was almost white, and her eyes were golden brown. I looked away for a split second at my wife and the child was gone. About 30 seconds later, I heard that same voice say &amp;quot;momma&amp;quot; just as a few hours earlier. My wife did not see her nor hear her, but she very clearly heard it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The age of this child is what mine would have been, had I not miscarried. The father is blonde with golden eyes. She had my curls and his chubby cheeks. I could just feel that she was my baby. She came to me because I needed something to keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr : I met the ghost of my miscarried daughter in a time of need, and boy, was she beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"(sorry I know this is quite long, and I'm new here)\\n\\nI've always had quite vivid dreams, even when I was very young. Mostly they'd be about strange and random things but didn't bother me much, and I enjoyed telling friends about them.\\n\\nHowever, recently I've noticed that my dreams have become quite strange.\\n\\nPretty much since I turned 16  in Dec, the same girl has appeared in my dreams. What I find strange is not only how I can remember her face quite clearly, but also how I seem to see her in another time, like it's a past life. I cannot possibly describe all of my dreams with her in detail, as each one would be at least 2000 words long. I will provide a few though, in italics.\\n\\n*The first time I met her we seemed to be in a garden, with a wooden swing bench and a tree in the middle. I waited there and then she appeared under the tree, I kissed her and then we made out on the bench. We then went down to a city and flew around and even walked through shops and streets, but we were still invisible to everyone else. At some point I did become visible at will though, scaring a man in a bookstore, which I thought was funny. The dream ended with us departing on a boat somewhere. The landscape was not natural at all. I believe this dream was more of a symbolic one than literal one, and a few of my dreams with her are like that.*\\n\\nAlthough I'm not a heavily spiritual person, I do believe these are past life dreams.Some of the past life dreams are more normal though, like us going to a beach or a town for example. Other ones do not feature her at all, and are just memories of another family or moments by myself. For timelines sake, I believe the ones with her took place in the very late 90s, especially how I remember watching in a cinema and also seeing an advert for Ep.1 of Star Wars, which came out in 1999 I believe. My relationship with her seems to be quite a close one, I'm quite sure homosexual, though I don't understand how we would have hidden that since homophobia was still common in the 90s. We seem to have a car as well, though I think it is more likely hers since she has driven it in all of the occasions I have seen her. It's a red car, I don't know the model but it seems to be from the late 80s or early 90s. I have searched online for one similar with no luck. I have also tried searching for the locations in my dreams on google maps, but I gave up a few days later realising it will take a lifetime. I would also like to add that I have seen a very similar car in real life after those dreams, but only twice. It was quite elusive both times though, I didn't get to see a driver or model.\\n\\nThis is where things become even more spiritual, though. Recently I haven't dreamt of her I don't think, but there have been many strange signs irl. For example, last Friday I decided to go on a small walk before returning home. I didn't go far, just down a street near my own house. At one of the dead ends of this street is a wall overlooking a graveyard. I just wanted to know if there was a bench I could read on so I looked over it. When I turned back around to return home, I walked a bit then found a plain brown glass marble leaning against the kerb. I picked it up, and it instantly reminded me of her. It was kind of chipped in some places, but I still thought it was nice. It had a warm aura to it, it reminded me of her eyes and her seemingly gentle nature. The next evening a bead I found like 2 years ago was on the floor next to me for some reason whilst I was doing revision. I was certain I had kept it in a drawer somewhere, but just guessed I might have taken it out accidentally. I believe it's a rosary bead, but I'm not too sure. It's wooden and spherical with a small hole, but seems to have a glossy layer over it and the wood shines when rolled in light.\\n\\nBefore I went to sleep last night, I remembered that meditation does help me sleep sometimes, so I decided to try it out again. However, this time I held the marble and bead in a hand each, meditating for about 2 minutes. I don't know why I did that, out of curiosity maybe? I managed to fall asleep better than usual though, however the dream I had was not normal at all, even for me.\\n\\n*I was in a dense forest, and it was quite dark, but not night. The sky was grey like it was about to rain heavily. The trees had some leaves, but they were quite faded, either dark green or brown. The area I was in had some wooden structures, like huts and walled areas made out of wooden planks. But they had been completely abandoned. I suddenly felt like I was being watched, so I found my way out of that area. I found a clearing which  was wooden decking over a very circular lake or pool. It had 5 symmetrical pentagonal huts which were all different colours and left to rot. One of them i remember had dark blue tarpaulin with white or yellow stars covering it. I still had a strong feeling of being watched, but from behind me, and I began running around the clearing looking for a place to hide or leave as I panicked. I stopped and glanced into the woods to my right. A dark figure or shadow met me when I stopped. It stared directly at me, and I couldn't tell if it was a pace ahead of me or a pace behind. Before I could do anything, I was in a car park, behind some run down buildings. There was a few vans and no one was around. The feeling was strong, and I instantly closed my eyes. I didn't want to see anything. I looked towards the ground. Through the slits of my eyes i could see it standing right in front of me. The fear became intimidation, but the moment before I woke up it suddenly felt reassuring. I woke up after that in the dead of night and my room was silent but i felt like i was being watched, it was an intense feeling, almost like someone was actually there. I was too scared to check though, since this has never happened to me so strongly before. I just faced the wall and instantly went back to sleep which is weird for me.*\\n\\nIn addition to this, today at 15:41 I noticed my ear had become infected, which I thought was very strange since I take very good care of my piercings and just my hygiene in general. As I arrived home at about 15:50, I helped my mother with the shopping, and she noticed a small object on the floor. She did not recognise it, and asked me if it was mine. I took it from her and later inspected it. At first I thought it was a brooche or pin, however after further inspection I realised it was an earring that had the metal stick thing bent. It was a small silver owl with black gemstone eyes, and a larger grey gemstone stomach. I found an earring after my ear became suddenly infected, I thought this was odd.\\n\\nI think that maybe these objects are left by her for me, kind of like little presents or what's on my mind. The marble can be due to the fact that in the past week I was thinking about how I used to find marbles a lot as a child, along with other random things. Then the earring could be a result of my ear being infected. But since I found a lot of things as a child, does this mean she was always around?\\n\\nI don't have much else to say right at this moment, other than that whenever I seem to speak of someone in any manner they seem to either appear in real life or join a voice chat instantly. Also, whenever I get bad vibes from someone, I always turn out to be right these days.\\n\\nI've woken up crying after these dreams a few times, since I feel immense sorrow deep down somewhere after them, but I also feel joy after I see her.\\n\\nIt's been on my mind for months, I'd be really grateful for any kind of explanation, and for advice on what I can do to get some kind of stronger connection with her, to see her more in my dreams properly and maybe communicate with her safely.\\n\\nIf you have read this far down then thank you, it means a lot.\",\n",

Also, whenever I get bad vibes from someone, I always turn out to be right these days.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve woken up crying after these dreams a few times, since I feel immense sorrow deep down somewhere after them, but I also feel joy after I see her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been on my mind for months, I&amp;#39;d be really grateful for any kind of explanation, and for advice on what I can do to get some kind of stronger connection with her, to see her more in my dreams properly and maybe communicate with her safely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you have read this far down then thank you, it means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'When I was younger me and my friends enjoyed exploring abandoned houses. We had been to many, in and around our town. There was a specific house that we went back to many times to explore. It was a big building, split into two sides and very old, probably from the 18th century. It had a basement, 10 bedrooms and an attic (that we never managed to get into). \\n\\nI first discovered it when me and one other friend saw it from a field nearby my house. We had a look round and were pretty creeped out to say the least. There was a stairwell that lead to an underground room underneath the house that you could get to from outside. We went in and all the lights were on...we soon left after discovering this.\\n\\nA few weeks later we were out with a group of our mates. There was probably 7 or 8 of us. We got the idea of returning to the house and so we did. We managed to get in this time, and we had a look round. All the lights worked and were connected to electricity, which confused me but we continued to look round. There was a large basement with furnaces and oven etc. All the rooms were pretty similar and we soon left as there wasn’t an awful amount to do.\\n\\nAnyway, to the point. Recently me and two other friends decided to go back to the house. We were bored and figured it would be fun. It was around 8pm when we left so it was pitch black. The house backed onto a field so we chose to get to it from there. It was about a 15 minute walk from my house so it didn’t take us long. We entered the field and began trudging towards the house. \\n\\nWe were slightly nervous, but we had done this before so it was nothing to be scared about. We slowly approached the back of the house, observing the windows (there were 5). It was very dark, but we did have a powerful torch so we had no trouble seeing. There was a fence surrounding the back of the house so in order to get in we would have to climb over this. My friend volunteered to go first and as he began climbing we heard the most terrifying sound. The word ‘meow’ came from inside of the house. We all froze. This was not a cat. Someone had mimicked the noise of a cat from inside of that house. For a split second we did nothing, and then we ran.\\n\\nAs we ran, a horrifying, cackling laugh came bellowing out of the house. We said nothing to each other we just sprinted towards the exit of the field. I was petrified and I was playing the noise over and over in my head, grimacing at who or what it could have been. When we got to the road we stopped running to catch our breath. We tried to discuss what had happened but none of us had answers, it was truly terrifying. We slowly calmed down as we walked towards my house and figured maybe it was somebody messing around. But that’s not the end of the story.\\n\\nMy house is very near to a mere which has a footpath that goes all the way around it. You can get to the town from my house by walking through the mere. On our way back we decided we wanted to go to town, still talking about what had happened and honestly still not really believing it actually had. We decided to cut through the mere to get to town as it was the quickest way, so we did. It was about 9pm by this point and any light was totally gone. I still had my touch, but we encountered a couple of walkers at the mere so I decided to turn it off so I wouldn’t blind anyone walking towards us. We walked and spoke as we entered the mere and it takes about 10 minutes to get round to the entrance to the town. It was very quiet, apart from our chatter there was no sound at all. Suddenly out of the bushes next to us came the same sound ‘meow’. It felt as if it was within a metre of us. This time we did not freeze. We ran so fucking fast away from that noise. The same cackling laugh came from the bushes as we ran, and I kid you not, it ran after us. Only for a short while, but it followed us as we sprinted away. \\n\\nTo this day, I don’t know who or what that noise came from. But it followed us back from that house. Thinking about someone watching us and following us all the way back and knowing where i live. It scared the hell out of me. It’s safe to say, I never went back to the house.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So I have a long story with lot of moving parts, so bear with me. I think I will tell this story in the order events as I found out about them, rather than how they chronologically occurred.\\n\\nTo begin, I have this recurring dream that I\\'ve been having since middle school. I have it one or two times a year, but it\\'s slowed down since I\\'ve gotten older. In the dream I\\'m at home, but it isn\\'t my house. It\\'s a big 2 or 3 story home that\\'s shaped like a U. I\\'ve never seen anything like it before. I go upstairs to my mom\\'s room in this dream and she\\'s on the bed, seizing. My first thought is that she must be possessed. I call my brother in a panic and tell him mom is possessed. He just asks me if we need more bread or milk, because he\\'s grocery shopping. We fight back and forth, he refuses to listen, and I eventually hang up and try to help my mom myself. Before I can do anything she stops seizing and looks out the window. I run to the window that overlooks the pool (in the middle of the U). I see a spirit flying into (out of?) the pool. I don\\'t hear anything but I know his name is Chris. My mom is fine again.\\n\\nIt\\'s a weird dream to keep having, but I\\'ve never thought too much of it. \\n\\nMoving forward to when I was in college. There was a Ouija board that had been on the game shelf of my house for as long as I can remember. None of us have ever touched it or played it, but it has always been there. I asked if I could take it with me to college. I thought it would be fun for my friends and I to use. I\\'ve been very interested in paranormal, but never really believed in it. I take it, and the first time I use it, I ask if it knows me. It says yes. I ask how. It spells MAMA. I disregard it, my friends I use it several times after that. Nothing particularly interesting really happens in the hundreds of other uses.\\n\\nOne night, a few years later, my family is all sitting in a hot tub late at night in late fall in our backyard. We were just looking at the stars but my little brother suggested we tell ghost stories. No one could come up with any, so we started talking about weird dreams and the meanings behind them instead. I offered to share mine, as I recently had one that I had several times before.\\n\\nI tell this dream to my family and my mom and dad turn their necks so quickly to look at each other I swear I hear them crack. I ask them what\\'s wrong and they say Chris is just someone from their past. They act awfully strange for a bit before my mom says that she does, actually, have a ghost story.\\n\\nWhen my parents were teenagers and still dating my mom bought a Ouija board (the same one I took with me to college). She convinced my dad to use it with her and the had fun asking it questions about their future and what not. They ask several questions about their future and specifically, it if they\\'ll ever have their own cars. It answers \"Grand Prix.\" They asked for the name of the ghost their speaking to and it said *Christopher.* They didn\\'t really play with it again due to just lack of interest.\\n\\nSeveral months (maybe years?) after their first experience, my mom buys her first car. Lo and behold, it\\'s a Grand Prix. I think the fact that the Ouija board predicted that was a realization they had several months after the purchase. Could be chocked up to subconscious, but a little weird.\\n\\n**I will refer to my mom as \"M\" from here on**\\n\\nSeveral months after the car, my parents are visiting friends in another state. They\\'re there for a Superbowl party, I think. They\\'re out of snacks for the party so my mom offers to drive to the store and get some. Now, my mom has always been a big fan of personalized license plates. So, of course, her Grand Prix had a license plate that said \"M\\'s GP\".\\n\\nShe gets to the grocery store and the bag boy helped her carry her groceries to her car. They\\'re loading them into the truck and he sees her license plate.\\n\\n\"Is your name M?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, it\\'s my Grand Prix, why?\"\\n\\n\"My friends in I were playing with a Ouija board the other night and it just kept saying \"where M, where M?\"\\n\\nShe did not talk any longer with the bag boy or exchange any kind of information.\\n\\nNow, to top things off, I\\'m working at my first job after college. I\\'ve been here for nearly two years, and only a few weeks ago did I realize, the building I work in is 3 stories tall and shaped like a U. It is nearly identical to the one from my dream, save for the fact there\\'s a courtyard instead of a pool in the center.\\n\\n I\\'d love to hear any thoughts. It definitely feels like someone is looking for my mom, and now going through me to find her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s worth noting but my mom also seems to have a sort of sixth sense? She has dreams about people in strange rooms before they die, she\\'s ran into someone in the grocery store and thought  \"he doesn\\'t seem well\" weeks before he is diagnosed with cancer (and was outwardly 100% fine and normal), and she has told me that a few times as a child she has been so angry with someone (bullying her brother), she can\\'t stop thinking about how much she hates them, and they\\'ve died shortly after.',\n",

Her husband and two friends they were with died, and the only reason she survived is because her husband wrapped his body around hers to protect her from the impact.\\n\\nAfter the plane crash, she was in the hospital in a coma for 3 weeks. During that coma, she saw a light at the end of a tunnel. She wanted to go towards the light but a figure appeared at the end. The figure said “You can’t go, you have to stay. You’re not done here yet.” She told the figure she wanted to go and it insisted she had to stay. She has hinted that this figure may have been her husband.\\n\\nShe recovered fully from the coma and went on to remarry, have her three beautiful daughters, then remarry again to my grandpa (she is technically my step grandmother). My grandpa, her third husband, is a pilot. Until they married, she had not been in a plane since the crash and never planned on getting in a plane again, yet she now (miraculously) flies comfortably with my grandpa. She believes \\n that the reason she could not go when she wanted to was because she hadn’t yet had her daughters. She is in her 70s now, and for the first time in her life, after years of therapy, she can tell this story without visibly getting upset. She is an incredibly strong, caring woman and I believe her story with my whole heart, as does she.',\n",

Her husband and two friends they were with died, and the only reason she survived is because her husband wrapped his body around hers to protect her from the impact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the plane crash, she was in the hospital in a coma for 3 weeks. During that coma, she saw a light at the end of a tunnel. She wanted to go towards the light but a figure appeared at the end. The figure said “You can’t go, you have to stay. You’re not done here yet.” She told the figure she wanted to go and it insisted she had to stay. She has hinted that this figure may have been her husband.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She recovered fully from the coma and went on to remarry, have her three beautiful daughters, then remarry again to my grandpa (she is technically my step grandmother). My grandpa, her third husband, is a pilot. Until they married, she had not been in a plane since the crash and never planned on getting in a plane again, yet she now (miraculously) flies comfortably with my grandpa. She believes \\n that the reason she could not go when she wanted to was because she hadn’t yet had her daughters. She is in her 70s now, and for the first time in her life, after years of therapy, she can tell this story without visibly getting upset. She is an incredibly strong, caring woman and I believe her story with my whole heart, as does she.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'About a week ago me and some friends were in a small old town. Old as in 100s of years old, these houses are at least a century old. Ghost town as you might put it. The town has about 2 streets. \\n\\nMe and a friend walk up to this house. This house was an old two story house with the small creepy windows at the top. It had a half wrapped around porch like the centennial houses back in the days. It has a wheel chair lift (which was up) onto their porch. \\n\\nThe porch is completely fenced off so you can only stand on the steps. We notice that all of the windows and doors are blocked off. Like they have so much crap on their porch that there is no way into the house from the porch. Which was odd. Why would the wheelchair life be up if there’s no way into the house? We reasoned that either there’s still a person in a wheelchair inside or that someone put it up so people wouldn’t use it. There was also two cars in the driveway.\\n\\nAnyways, we got back into the car, and I could feel someone watching me. I also got this strong wave of sadness. I knew something was off, and I didn’t feel like myself anymore. I felt so sad all of a sudden. My brain and thought process was turned to mush.\\n\\nWe stayed in this town for about 30 more minutes. I really wanted to get out of this town. I felt like something was really off. \\n\\nI noticed this guy. There was this guy sitting in his car on the side of the road. He had his phone out and it looked like he was video taping us. I think he noticed that we were watching him because he drove away. This could explain some of this lol. \\n\\nAs we passed that house to get out of town, the sadness went away in a wave. I was completely back to normal.',\n",

Anyway, when  I was in high school (2014ish) my parents, one of my friends, and I went on a trip to New Mexico from Kentucky.

My mom comes to pick me up and, as we’re driving on the highway we go on a ramp. But, I notice before my mom does that it’s not done and, literally drops off. As I go to tell my mom she notices too but, at that point it was too late so, we start saying our I love yous, holding hands and our goodbyes. Surprisingly, the fall is slow and as we’re dropping in what feels like slow motion, we see all the lights of the cars on the other levels like a light show. This makes us laugh and we stay holding hands finally the car lands w a little jolt but we’re in one piece. As I go to express my surprise to my mom I feel my eyes droop and my neck just falls to the side. I woke up from it relatively calm but as I wake I realized there was smt at the foot of my bed. Couldn’t see a face or anything just a tall figure looking at me w his head tilted. For a sec I thought a man was watching me bc I could make out a white shirt and his figure was def not female. But all while I was running thru these things in my mind, unbeknownst to me I was screaming non stop so much so that my mom rushed to my room. As soon as my mom touched me he literally whisped away like smoke or sand in the wind. This all happened at 6 am btw so no devil hour and such. \\nThat day I later took a nap and, as I was napping I felt this intense bright light behind my eyes and, could not move or open my eyes. So, I just started praying to god to let me out of it and, as I said it I felt the light shutter away and I could open my eyes. Needless to say, I slept w in my parents room w my mom that night. I woke up at 6 again and, at the foot of my bed is the same figure but he’s not curious anymore just watching. I began screaming unknowingly again and, as soon as my mom touched me he whisped away again. \\nThat morning I told my mom adamant about what I saw. She then called my aunt (who is b spiritual and connected) and asked, she told my mom that was my guardian angel trying to warn me about a threat to/in my life. She said I’m lucky if I can see him and not many can say they have. \\nSo, the next night before I went to bed I prayed to god to never show me him again because, whatever threat was possibly in my life I think the Angel he sent would take me sooner than that w a heart attack. I also asked to send a handsome one and, not a terrifying one. I feel bad that I shut him out but, I can’t keep screaming awake. \\n\\nA lot of people I’ve read say that they hear their guardian angel or angel speak to them but, I haven’t read or heard of them seeing them fully. \\n \\nPlease share your experience if it’s similar to mine!

       "   'selftext': \"Tonight I had a strange experience out in the woods on the perimeter of my university campus and I'd love to have some second opinions on what could've been happening. At around 8:30 pm, my friends (2 others) and I decided to ditch our responsibilities for a while and go out on a walk around campus. We eventually found ourselves at the edge of the campus, where the forest begins. Collectively we all just shrugged and decided, why not take a walk in the forest?\\n\\nThe forest itself is really, really large, spanning several hundred acres, and we had walked pretty far once it started to rain more than we would've liked. My friends and I had all packed umbrellas, so we opened them up and decided to turn around and make the trip back to campus. On our way back, at about halfway out,  we heard a loud sobbing sound coming from several metres behind us. To me, it sounded like a woman drawing out her sobbing for a few seconds and then stopping. The sound wasn't coming from behind us on the dirt path we were walking on, rather from several metres behind us within the forest.\\n\\nMy friends and I had been walking with a phone flashlight pointed to the ground ahead of us, and upon hearing the crying sound, we sped up and walked faster to get **OUT OF THERE**. There would be a period of silence, then the sound would repeat, with each repeat coming up closer next to us (to our left, still within the forest). Each repeat of the sobbing sounded less distinctly like a person crying and more animal-like, which was concerning because it was seemingly following us. It also sounded like there were two sounds happening, one after the other, but ending at the same time. The sound repeated maybe 2 or 3 times, with the last call/cry we heard was about matched to where we were,  still metres away in the forest (parallel, not right directly beside us). I was on the leftmost side of the path and I kept my eyes on the woods the whole time as we sped walked OUT of there, but I wasn't able to see anything moving or trace where/what the sound was coming from.\\n\\nOnce we were out of the forest and far enough away that we were properly back on campus, I pulled out my phone to look up fox/coyote calls on youtube to see if anything sounded similar, but every clip I listened to sounded too dog-like. I'd say that the closest might've been some fox soundbites, but they sounded too high pitched and more like wailing than sobbing. I can't imagine that any animal would've wanted to tail us considering we were three people who were talking/laughing fairly loudly, with umbrellas open, and a bright light trained on the ground ahead of us. My friends shrugged the experience off and tried to rationalize it by saying that it was likely dogs out in the woods, but I know what we heard and I know that it definitely was not anyone's dog. No one would've been walking in the forest in the rain at 9 pm on a Monday (other than us crazies), so I really don't know what it could've been. I really wish I had taken my phone out earlier and recorded the noise as it was happening, but I'm not sure if I'd ever want to relive that again.\",\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Long story short, when I was a kid I would wake up to what I can only describe as Native American drums in my attic. I live near the river and on the trail of tears, I’m also part cherokee ( not that it matters really) Anyways, one night the drumming became so loud that it scared me so I did what any child would do, I ran to my parents room to get my mom. She got up and went with me back to my room where the drums were still going, so I asked her what it was and why was it so loud?? She looked at me with all seriousness and told me she heard nothing. Absolutely nothing. At that point I started crying because I thought there was no way she couldn’t hear it and that she had to be lying. I begged her to stop playing with me, to tell me she heard it too, basically screamed at her because it was so loud. She swore and promised and everything else that she didn’t and, couldn’t hear anything. I told her I was scared and I didn’t know why it was happening, after I said that it stopped being so loud and only played softly. I let her go back to bed and tried to go back to sleep again, now that it was quieter. I eventually drifted off. After that night they’d play softly and it never scared me again. Then over time as I grew older I just stopped hearing it. I think maybe it’s because I’m older now that I don’t hear them anymore but I feel as though they were there to comfort me at night as a kid and didn’t mean to scare me. Childhood was rough at home, it felt like they just wanted to help. I do miss them.. Anyway, thanks for reading guys! Just wanted to share.',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, when I was a kid I would wake up to what I can only describe as Native American drums in my attic. I live near the river and on the trail of tears, I’m also part cherokee ( not that it matters really) Anyways, one night the drumming became so loud that it scared me so I did what any child would do, I ran to my parents room to get my mom. She got up and went with me back to my room where the drums were still going, so I asked her what it was and why was it so loud?? She looked at me with all seriousness and told me she heard nothing. Absolutely nothing. At that point I started crying because I thought there was no way she couldn’t hear it and that she had to be lying. I begged her to stop playing with me, to tell me she heard it too, basically screamed at her because it was so loud. She swore and promised and everything else that she didn’t and, couldn’t hear anything. I told her I was scared and I didn’t know why it was happening, after I said that it stopped being so loud and only played softly. I let her go back to bed and tried to go back to sleep again, now that it was quieter. I eventually drifted off. After that night they’d play softly and it never scared me again. Then over time as I grew older I just stopped hearing it. I think maybe it’s because I’m older now that I don’t hear them anymore but I feel as though they were there to comfort me at night as a kid and didn’t mean to scare me. Childhood was rough at home, it felt like they just wanted to help. I do miss them.. Anyway, thanks for reading guys! Just wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
